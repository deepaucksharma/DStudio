## Remaining Stub Files

Based on the search, there are approximately 100+ files still marked as stubs that could benefit from similar enhancement:

### High Priority (Very Small Files <30 lines)
- Pattern files: chunking, deduplication, delta-sync, trie, vector-tiles
- Case studies: Apple Maps, Here Maps, Life360, Snap Map, Strava Heatmaps

### Medium Priority (30-50 lines)
- Pattern files: client-rendering, content-extraction, crawler-traps, geofencing
- Quantitative models: computational-geometry, graph-theory, privacy-metrics

### Low Priority (Already have some content)
- Files with 50+ lines that need expansion
- Files with basic structure but missing examples

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Enhancement Process**:
   - Focus on high-priority small files first
   - Add at least 150-200 lines of meaningful content per file
   - Include practical examples and visualizations

2. **Maintain Consistency**:
   - Keep "planned for future development" notice
   - Follow established content structure
   - Include related patterns/references

3. **Quality Guidelines**:
   - Add working code examples
   - Include architecture diagrams
   - Provide real-world context
   - Explain trade-offs and limitations

4. **Next Batch Targets**:
   - Spatial patterns (vector-tiles, tile-pyramid, spatial-indexing)
   - Web crawling patterns (crawler-traps, politeness, url-frontier)
   - Coordination patterns (hlc, anti-entropy, choreography)

## Impact

The enhanced stub files now provide:
- **Immediate Value**: Readers get substantial preview content
- **Learning Resources**: Working code examples and explanations
- **Architecture Insights**: Visual diagrams and system designs
- **Practical Guidance**: Real-world applications and best practices

Each enhanced file maintains its "stub" status while offering enough content to be genuinely useful for learning and reference purposes.
