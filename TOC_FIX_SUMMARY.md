# TOC Fix Summary

## Issue
"On This Page" (Table of Contents) on the right side doesn't get updated on page load when using MkDocs Material's `navigation.instant` feature.

## Root Cause
When `navigation.instant` is enabled, MkDocs Material uses XHR requests to load new pages without full page refreshes. This prevents the TOC from being properly re-initialized with the new page content.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced custom.js
Added a new function `fixInstantNavigationTOC()` that:
- Listens for navigation changes using Material's `window.location$` observable
- Re-initializes the TOC after each navigation
- Forces Material theme to update TOC component
- Ensures active navigation items are visible

### 2. Fixed mkdocs.yml
- Updated incorrect reference: `uber-systems.md` â†’ `uber-location.md` and `uber-maps.md`

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. Subscribing to Material's location change events
2. Waiting 100ms for DOM updates to complete
3. Re-running TOC enhancement
4. Dispatching a custom DOMContentLoaded event to trigger Material's TOC update
5. Scrolling active navigation items into view

## Testing Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run dev server: `mkdocs serve`
3. Navigate between pages using the sidebar
4. Verify that "On This Page" TOC updates correctly
5. Check that TOC highlighting works when scrolling

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)

If the JavaScript solution doesn't fully resolve the issue, you could:

1. **Disable instant navigation** (not recommended):
   ```yaml
   theme:
     features:
       # - navigation.instant  # Comment out
   ```

2. **Use Material's built-in TOC refresh** (if available in newer versions):
   Check if newer MkDocs Material versions have a built-in fix

3. **Force full page reload for specific pages**:
   Add data attributes to links that should trigger full reload

The implemented solution maintains the instant navigation experience while ensuring TOC updates properly.
