# Episode Outline Template
## For Engaging, Interactive Technical Content

---

## EPISODE METADATA
- **Episode Number**: X.Y (Series.Episode)
- **Title**: [Catchy title that hints at the problem]
- **Subtitle**: [What specific thing they'll learn]
- **Duration**: 25 minutes (interactive)
- **Style**: Conversational, checkpoint-driven, practical-first

---

## OPENING HOOK (2 min)
Start with a question or shocking statement that makes them think about their own system.

```markdown
"[Provocative question about their current setup]"

[Specific dollar amount or time cost of not knowing this]

[Real company that learned this the hard way]

**[IMMEDIATE CHECK]**
[Simple test they can do in 10 seconds to see if they have this problem]
- If yes → [They need this episode urgently]
- If no → [They'll learn how to keep it that way]
```

---

## MODULE 1: Concept Introduction (5 min)
### Make It Intuitive First

Start with analogy or real-world parallel, no technical jargon yet.

```markdown
"[Conversational explanation using everyday language]"

[Simple example everyone can relate to]

**[CHECKPOINT 1]**
[Interactive question about their experience]
- Option A → [Tailored response]
- Option B → [Different angle]
- Option C → [Advanced path]
```

---

## MODULE 2: The Problem Pattern (5 min)
### Show Them What Goes Wrong

Real incidents with timeline and costs.

```markdown
[COMPANY] - [DATE]
═══════════════════
[Time] - [What happened]
[Time] - [Cascade effect]
[Time] - [Total failure]
Cost: $[specific amount]
Root cause: [One sentence]

**[PATTERN RECOGNITION]**
Check if your system has:
□ [Dangerous pattern 1]
□ [Dangerous pattern 2]
□ [Dangerous pattern 3]
```

---

## MODULE 3: The Technical Deep Dive (5 min)
### Now Show The Math/Code

Only after they understand the concept intuitively.

```python
# WRONG - What everyone does
[Bad code example with clear problem]

# RIGHT - What actually works
[Good code example with explanation]

# WHY IT MATTERS
[Specific metric improvement]
```

**[INTERACTIVE EXERCISE]**
```markdown
Fix this dangerous code:
[Broken code snippet]

Your fix: ________________
```

---

## MODULE 4: Implementation Guide (5 min)
### Practical Steps They Can Take

Multiple approaches with clear tradeoffs.

```markdown
OPTION 1: Quick Fix (1 day)
- What: [Specific change]
- Cost: [Time/money]
- Benefit: [% improvement]
- When to use: [Clear criteria]

OPTION 2: Proper Solution (1 week)
- What: [Bigger change]
- Cost: [Time/money]
- Benefit: [% improvement]
- When to use: [Clear criteria]

OPTION 3: Gold Standard (1 month)
- What: [Best practice]
- Cost: [Time/money]
- Benefit: [% improvement]
- When to use: [Clear criteria]
```

**[DECISION FRAMEWORK]**
```markdown
Based on your downtime cost:
- < $10K/hour → Option 1
- $10K-100K/hour → Option 2
- > $100K/hour → Option 3
```

---

## MODULE 5: Detection & Monitoring (3 min)
### How to Know If You Have The Problem

Specific metrics and queries they can run.

```yaml
DETECTION FRAMEWORK
═══════════════════

Leading Indicators:
□ [Metric 1] > [threshold]
□ [Metric 2] increasing
□ [Metric 3] pattern

Real-time Detection:
[Specific query or dashboard]

Post-Incident Analysis:
[Log analysis command]
```

---

## ACTION PLAN (2 min)
### Concrete Next Steps

```markdown
TODAY (Find Problems):
[Specific audit command or check]

THIS WEEK (Measure Risk):
[Monitoring to add]

THIS MONTH (Fix Issues):
1. [Priority 1 fix]
2. [Priority 2 fix]
3. [Priority 3 fix]
```

---

## CLOSING CHALLENGE

One question that makes them think:

**"[Specific scenario question about their system]"**

If [bad answer], you have a problem.
If [good answer], you're ready for [next level].

**Next Episode**: "[Title of next episode]"

---

## QUICK REFERENCE
### The Essentials

```markdown
KEY FORMULA/PATTERN:
[The one thing to remember]

DANGER SIGNS:
- [Red flag 1]
- [Red flag 2]
- [Red flag 3]

EMERGENCY FIXES:
[Command to run when things break]
```

---

## ENGAGEMENT PATTERNS TO USE

### Throughout the Episode:
1. **Start with questions** - Make them think about their system
2. **Use "you/your"** - Direct address, not abstract
3. **Give choices** - Let them pick their path
4. **Include exercises** - 30-second activities
5. **Show the money** - Every problem has a cost
6. **Provide checkpoints** - Let them evaluate their risk
7. **Offer alternatives** - Not everyone needs the same solution
8. **End with action** - Specific things to do today

### Language Style:
- "Love the energy" - Acknowledge their engagement
- "Here's the thing" - Conversational transitions
- "Quick check" - Interactive moments
- "Your turn" - Hand over control
- "Let's be honest" - Build trust
- "Want to know why?" - Create curiosity

### Structure Flow:
Hook → Intuition → Problem → Technical → Implementation → Detection → Action

Each module should stand alone but build on previous ones.
