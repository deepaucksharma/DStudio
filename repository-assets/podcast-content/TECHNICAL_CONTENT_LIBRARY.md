# Technical Content Library: Distributed Systems Architecture

## 1. CORRELATION AND DEPENDENCY FAILURES

### Hidden Dependencies in Distributed Systems

**The Correlation Problem**
- Systems assumed independent share hidden dependencies
- Common failure sources: same rack, same power supply, same network switch, same DNS provider, same deployment pipeline, same configuration management system
- Correlation coefficient in failures: typically ρ = 0.7-0.95 for "independent" services

**AWS EBS Storm (2011)**
- Impact: $7 billion in customer losses
- Root cause: Control plane shared across "independent" availability zones
- Timeline: Network upgrade → EBS nodes lose connectivity → re-mirroring storm → secondary AZ overwhelmed → control plane APIs timeout globally
- Lesson: Data plane isolation meaningless if control plane is shared

**Knight Capital (2012)**
- Impact: $440 million loss in 45 minutes
- Root cause: Deployment correlation - 7 servers updated, 1 missed
- Old code + new feature flags = unintended behavior
- Correlation factor: 1.0 (all orders moved together)

**Facebook BGP Outage (2021)**
- Impact: $852 million, 6-hour global outage
- Root cause: BGP configuration error + physical security dependency
- Engineers couldn't enter datacenters - badge readers needed the network
- Circular dependency: fix requires physical access, access requires network

### Solutions to Correlation

**Cell-Based Architecture**
- Divide system into isolated cells
- Each cell serves subset of users
- Blast radius = 1/number of cells
- No shared dependencies between cells
- Examples: AWS (shuffle sharding), Netflix (regional cells)

**Bulkhead Pattern**
- Resource isolation between components
- Separate thread pools, connection pools, CPU cores
- Prevents cascade failures
- Inspired by ship design

**Shuffle Sharding**
- Each user gets random subset of servers
- Overlap between users minimized
- Failure impact dramatically reduced
- Used by AWS for customer isolation

## 2. CASCADE FAILURES AND RETRY STORMS

### The Cascade Pattern

**Retry Amplification**
- Service slows down → timeouts trigger → retries begin → load multiplies → service dies
- Cascade probability formula: P(cascade) = 1 - (1/(retry_rate × timeout))
- When P > 0.5, collapse inevitable

**Knight Capital Retry Storm**
- Configuration: 50ms timeout, 10ms retry interval
- Result: 10x traffic amplification per layer
- System operating at 87% capacity → immediate collapse
- No circuit breakers or backoff

**Facebook DNS Cascade (2021)**
- DNS timeout: 5 seconds
- Retry interval: 1 second  
- Every service retrying DNS lookups
- Multiplication effect across entire infrastructure

### Preventing Cascades

**Exponential Backoff**
- Initial retry: 1 second
- Second retry: 2 seconds
- Third retry: 4 seconds
- Add jitter to prevent synchronization
- Maximum retry limit enforced

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Closed state: normal operation, count failures
- Open state: fail fast, don't attempt calls
- Half-open state: test with limited traffic
- Prevents cascade amplification
- Examples: Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j

**Timeout Hierarchies**
- Total user timeout: 30 seconds
- API gateway: 29 seconds
- Service layer: 25 seconds  
- Database: 20 seconds
- Each layer has smaller timeout to prevent stacking

## 3. PHASE TRANSITIONS IN SYSTEMS

### System Behavior at Scale

**The 70% Threshold**
- Below 70% utilization: linear response
- 70-85% utilization: exponential degradation begins
- Above 85%: system collapse, queuing theory breaks down
- Little's Law: L = λW (queue length = arrival rate × wait time)

**Universal Scalability Law**
- Contention: serialization points limit scaling
- Coherency: coordination overhead grows with scale
- C(N) = N / (1 + α(N-1) + βN(N-1))
- Most systems hit coherency limits before contention

### Real Phase Transitions

**Twitter Fail Whale Era**
- Timeline generation hit scalability limit
- Every user timeline required joining data from all followed users
- O(N²) complexity at scale
- Solution: pre-computed timelines, eventual consistency

**GitHub Database Saturation**
- MySQL connection pool exhaustion at 73% load
- Exponential increase in query wait times
- Connection timeout cascades
- Solution: read replicas, query optimization

**Robinhood GameStop Surge**
- 10x normal trading volume
- System entered phase transition at 82% capacity
- Clearing house deposit requirements calculation overwhelmed
- Multiple day outage during critical trading period

## 4. GRAY FAILURES

### Partial System Degradation

**Definition**
- System appears healthy to monitoring
- Users experience failures
- Health checks pass but real operations fail
- Gap between internal and external perspectives

**Common Gray Failure Patterns**
- Slow memory leaks not triggering alerts
- Partial network connectivity (can reach monitoring, not all services)
- Database accepting connections but queries timeout
- Cache serving stale data but appearing healthy
- Rate limiting affecting subset of users

### Detection Strategies

**Differential Observability**
- Compare internal metrics to customer metrics
- Synthetic transactions from external perspective
- Canary requests through full stack
- A/B testing to detect degradation

**Examples of Gray Failures**
- Azure Storage: disks slowing but not failing
- Google Cloud: persistent disk latency spikes
- AWS Lambda: cold starts affecting subset of invocations
- All passed health checks during failures

---

## 5. TIME SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUES

### The Impossibility of "Now"

**Clock Skew Reality**
- NTP accuracy: 1-10ms typically
- GPS requirement for microsecond accuracy
- Network latency makes perfect sync impossible
- Leap seconds cause coordination failures

**Google Spanner TrueTime**
- Investment: $100+ million in infrastructure
- GPS receivers + atomic clocks in each datacenter
- Provides uncertainty interval, not exact time
- Enables global consistency at 7 writes/second maximum

**Cloudflare Leap Second Incident**
- Different servers disagreed on current time
- CPU spinning at 100% across global network
- Some servers thought time went backward
- Solution: smear leap second over 24 hours

### Alternatives to Wall Clock Time

**Logical Clocks**
- Lamport timestamps: ordering without real time
- Vector clocks: track causality
- Hybrid logical clocks: combine physical and logical
- Event sourcing: order by sequence not time

- Monitor error rates and performance
- Gradually increase traffic
- Automatic rollback on anomalies

**Alert Design**
- Alert on symptoms, not causes
- Customer impact, not infrastructure
- Actionable alerts only
- Runbook for each alert
