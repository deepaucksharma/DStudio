# 🔗 Pattern Synthesis & Combination Tracking System

## Overview
This system tracks how distributed system patterns combine, interact, and evolve in real-world architectures. Based on analysis of 91 patterns across the podcast series, it documents synergies, conflicts, and proven combinations from industry leaders.

## 🎯 Pattern Combination Fundamentals

### Combination Types

#### 1. **Synergistic Combinations** (1+1>2)
Patterns that amplify each other's benefits when used together.

#### 2. **Complementary Combinations** (1+1=2)
Patterns that work well together without interference.

#### 3. **Neutral Combinations** (1+1=1.8)
Patterns that can coexist but may have minor overhead.

#### 4. **Conflicting Combinations** (1+1<1)
Patterns that interfere with each other or create problems.

- **Solution**: Use choreographed saga or async

#### 2. **Too Many Microservices + No Service Mesh**
- **Problem**: Operational complexity explosion
- **Solution**: Adopt service mesh or consolidate services

#### 3. **Strong Consistency + Geo-Distribution**
- **Problem**: High latency, availability issues
- **Solution**: Use eventual consistency or region-local consistency

#### 4. **Aggressive Caching + Frequent Updates**
- **Problem**: Cache invalidation nightmares
- **Solution**: Event-driven invalidation or TTL-based

#### 5. **Circuit Breaker + Long Timeouts**
- **Problem**: Circuit never opens

### Pattern Combination Rules

#### Rule 1: Layer Your Defenses
```
User Request
  → API Gateway (auth, rate limit)
    → Service Mesh (circuit breaker)
      → Service (business logic)
        → Cache (performance)
          → Database (persistence)
```

#### Rule 2: Isolate Failure Domains
```
Region A          Region B
├── Cell 1        ├── Cell 1
├── Cell 2        ├── Cell 2
└── Cell 3        └── Cell 3
(No cross-cell dependencies)
```

#### Rule 3: Async When Possible
```
Sync: A → B → C → D (latency adds up)
Async: A → [Queue] → B
           [Queue] → C
           [Queue] → D
```
