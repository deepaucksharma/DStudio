- **Timeline**: How Netflix's resilience patterns handled cascading datacenter failures
- **Human Drama**: Site reliability engineers managing crisis in real-time
- **Technical Hook**: Preview of patterns that enabled 99.99% uptime during disaster simulation

#### Part I: Circuit Breaker Mastery (40 minutes)
**Content Sources**: `/docs/pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker.md`

**Technical Deep Dive**:
```python
# Production-grade circuit breaker with ML-based threshold adaptation
class AdaptiveCircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
        self.success_rate_model = ExponentialWeightedMovingAverage(alpha=0.1)
        
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if self._should_attempt_reset():
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenException()
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise e
    
    def _should_attempt_reset(self):
        # Adaptive timeout based on failure history
        adaptive_timeout = self.recovery_timeout * (1 + self.failure_count * 0.1)
        return time.time() - self.last_failure_time > adaptive_timeout
```

**Netflix Case Study**: How circuit breakers prevented cascading failures during the 2017 S3 outage

#### Part II: Bulkhead Strategies (35 minutes)
**Content Sources**: `/docs/pattern-library/resilience/bulkhead.md`

**Resource Isolation Patterns**:
```python
# Thread pool bulkheading with dynamic sizing
class ResourceBulkhead:
    def __init__(self, resource_name, initial_pool_size=10):
        self.resource_name = resource_name
        self.thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=initial_pool_size)
        self.semaphore = Semaphore(initial_pool_size)
        self.performance_monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
        
    async def execute(self, task, priority=Priority.NORMAL):
        # Dynamic pool sizing based on performance metrics
        if self.performance_monitor.should_expand_pool():
            self._expand_pool()
        elif self.performance_monitor.should_contract_pool():
            self._contract_pool()
            
        async with self.semaphore:
            return await self.thread_pool.submit(task)
```

**Production Example**: Amazon's service isolation during Prime Day
- **Traffic Patterns**: 2.5x normal load, 15-minute traffic spikes
- **Bulkhead Strategy**: CPU, memory, and network bandwidth isolation
- **Results**: Zero cross-service contamination during peak load

#### Part III: Graceful Degradation (30 minutes)
**Content Sources**: `/docs/pattern-library/resilience/graceful-degradation.md`

**SLO-Driven Degradation**:
```python
# SLO-based feature toggling with real-time adjustment
class GracefulDegradationController:
    def __init__(self, slo_targets):
        self.slo_targets = slo_targets
        self.feature_flags = FeatureFlagManager()
        self.metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()
        
    def evaluate_degradation_need(self):
        current_performance = self.metrics_collector.get_current_metrics()
        
        for service, slo in self.slo_targets.items():
            if current_performance[service].error_rate > slo.error_rate:
                self._degrade_service(service, slo.degradation_strategy)
            elif current_performance[service].latency_p99 > slo.latency_p99:
                self._degrade_service(service, slo.degradation_strategy)
```

**Spotify Case Study**: Music recommendation degradation during traffic spikes
- **Strategy**: Fall back from ML recommendations to popularity-based lists
- **Performance**: Maintained < 200ms response time during 10x traffic spike
- **User Experience**: 94% user satisfaction maintained despite feature reduction

#### Part IV: Integration and Migration (25 minutes)
**Content Sources**: `/docs/excellence/migrations/anti-entropy-to-crdt.md`

**Migration Strategy**: From traditional retry mechanisms to resilience patterns
- **Assessment Framework**: Identifying failure modes in existing systems
- **Implementation Order**: Circuit breakers â†’ Bulkheads â†’ Graceful degradation
- **Success Metrics**: MTTR reduction, availability improvement, cost optimization
