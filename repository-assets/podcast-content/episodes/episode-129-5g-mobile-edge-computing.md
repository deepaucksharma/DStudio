# Episode 129: 5G and Mobile Edge Computing for Distributed Systems

## Introduction

5G networks and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) represent a fundamental transformation in how distributed systems are architected and deployed, enabling ultra-low latency applications, massive IoT connectivity, and new paradigms of computation at the network edge. The convergence of 5G's revolutionary wireless capabilities with edge computing infrastructure creates unprecedented opportunities for real-time, location-aware, and context-sensitive applications.

The mathematical foundations of 5G-enabled edge computing encompass advanced signal processing, optimization theory for radio resource allocation, queueing models for network performance, and distributed systems principles adapted for wireless environments with high mobility and variable connectivity. These systems must handle the unique challenges of radio propagation, interference management, handover procedures, and quality of service guarantees in mobile environments.

5G networks introduce new architectural concepts including Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and network slicing that enable dynamic resource allocation and service customization. Mobile Edge Computing extends this architecture by placing computational resources at the network edge, reducing latency from tens of milliseconds to single-digit milliseconds and enabling new classes of latency-critical applications.

## Theoretical Foundations (45 minutes)

### Mathematical Models for 5G Network Performance

5G networks can be modeled using advanced queueing theory, graph theory for network topology, and optimization theory for resource allocation. The fundamental mathematical framework encompasses multiple interconnected models for different network layers and functions.

**Radio Access Network (RAN) Modeling**: The 5G RAN can be modeled as a spatially distributed system with base stations (gNBs) providing coverage and capacity:

Base station capacity: C_i = B × log₂(1 + SINR_i)

Where B is the bandwidth and SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio) depends on:
- Transmitted power: P_tx
- Path loss: L(d) = L₀ + 10α log₁₀(d/d₀) + X_σ
- Interference: I = Σⱼ≠ᵢ P_j × G_ji
- Noise: N = kT₀BF

The Shannon-Hartley theorem provides the theoretical upper bound for channel capacity, but practical 5G systems achieve 70-90% of this theoretical limit through advanced modulation and coding schemes.

**Network Slicing Mathematical Framework**: 5G enables network slicing where virtual networks with different characteristics share physical infrastructure:

Slice resource allocation optimization:
**Maximize**: Σᵢ U_i(x_i)
**Subject to**: Σᵢ x_i ≤ C (capacity constraint)
             x_i ≥ R_i (minimum resource guarantee)
             QoS_i(x_i) ≥ SLA_i (quality constraints)

Where U_i(x_i) is the utility function for slice i, x_i is allocated resources, and QoS_i represents quality metrics like latency, bandwidth, and reliability.

**Mobility Modeling**: User mobility significantly impacts 5G network performance:

Random walk model: X(t+1) = X(t) + V(t)
Where V(t) is velocity vector with distribution depending on environment:
- Urban: Gaussian with low variance, frequent direction changes
- Highway: High velocity with directional persistence
- Indoor: Random waypoint with bounded area

Handover frequency: λ_ho = (v × L_boundary) / A_cell
Where v is user velocity, L_boundary is cell boundary length, and A_cell is cell area.

### Mobile Edge Computing Performance Models

MEC systems must be analyzed considering both computational and network performance, with particular attention to the impact of user mobility on service continuity and performance.

**MEC Server Placement Optimization**: Optimal placement of edge computing resources:

**Minimize**: Σᵢⱼ (d_ij × λ_ij × c_ij + f_j × y_j)
**Subject to**: 
- Σⱼ x_ij = 1 ∀i (each user served by one server)
- Σᵢ (λ_ij × r_i) ≤ C_j × y_j ∀j (capacity constraints)
- d_ij × x_ij ≤ D_max ∀i,j (latency constraints)

Where d_ij is distance, λ_ij is request rate, c_ij is communication cost, f_j is server deployment cost, and y_j indicates server deployment.

**Computation Offloading Models**: Decision framework for task distribution between mobile devices and edge servers:

Local execution time: T_local = C_task / f_mobile
Edge execution time: T_edge = T_transmission + C_task / f_edge + T_result

Total energy consumption: E_total = α × E_computation + β × E_communication

The offloading decision depends on optimizing:
**Minimize**: w₁ × T_total + w₂ × E_total + w₃ × Cost_monetary

**Service Migration Models**: Handle user mobility through service migration:

Migration cost: C_migration = C_state_transfer + C_service_downtime + C_network_resources

Migration decision threshold:
Migrate if: Future_benefit > Migration_cost + Hysteresis_margin

The hysteresis margin prevents ping-pong effects in migration decisions.

### Ultra-Low Latency Communication Models

5G promises sub-millisecond latency for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), requiring sophisticated models to achieve these targets.

**End-to-End Latency Decomposition**:
L_total = L_air + L_processing + L_transport + L_core + L_internet

- L_air: Radio access network latency (1-5ms)
- L_processing: Base station and edge processing (0.1-1ms)  
- L_transport: Transport network latency (0.1-2ms)
- L_core: Core network processing (0.1-1ms)
- L_internet: Internet routing latency (10-100ms)

**URLLC Resource Allocation**: Optimize radio resources for reliability and latency:

Reliability constraint: P(Latency > D) ≤ ε
Where D is deadline and ε is maximum failure probability (typically 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁹)

This requires sophisticated scheduling algorithms that consider:
- Channel quality indicators (CQI)
- Buffer status reports (BSR)
- Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) feedback
- Semi-persistent scheduling for predictable traffic

**Massive MIMO Performance Models**: 5G uses massive MIMO arrays with hundreds of antennas:

Channel capacity with M antennas: C = Σᵢ₌₁ʳ log₂(1 + λᵢ ρ/M)
Where λᵢ are eigenvalues of channel matrix H†H and ρ is signal-to-noise ratio.

Beamforming gain: G_bf = |w†h|² / (||w||² ||h||²)
Where w is beamforming vector and h is channel response vector.

For large M, capacity grows logarithmically with M due to pilot contamination and hardware impairments.

### Network Function Virtualization Models

5G networks extensively use NFV to provide flexible and programmable network services that can be dynamically instantiated and chained.

**Virtual Network Function (VNF) Placement**: Optimize placement of network functions:

**Minimize**: Σᵢⱼ (x_ij × (compute_cost_j + y_ij × communication_cost_ij))
**Subject to**:
- Σⱼ x_ij = 1 ∀i (each VNF placed exactly once)
- Σᵢ (x_ij × resource_demand_i) ≤ capacity_j ∀j
- Service chain constraints for dependent VNFs
- Latency constraints for time-sensitive services

**Service Function Chaining (SFC)**: Model service chains as directed graphs:
SFC = (V, E) where V represents VNFs and E represents dependencies

Path optimization through service chain:
**Minimize**: Σ_{(i,j)∈path} latency(i,j) + processing_delay(i)
**Subject to**: Resource constraints at each node

**VNF Scaling Models**: Auto-scaling based on load and performance metrics:

Scale-out trigger: CPU_utilization > threshold_high OR response_time > SLA_limit
Scale-in trigger: CPU_utilization < threshold_low AND buffer_empty

Scaling function: instances(t+1) = instances(t) × scaling_factor(load(t))

### Quality of Service and Service Level Agreement Models

5G networks must provide guaranteed QoS for diverse applications with different requirements, necessitating sophisticated traffic management and resource allocation models.

**Multi-Class Traffic Models**: Different traffic classes with distinct QoS requirements:

- eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband): High bandwidth, moderate latency
- URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency): Low latency, high reliability  
- mMTC (Massive Machine Type Communication): Low power, massive connectivity

Traffic model for each class:
λ_class(t) = λ_base × seasonal(t) × daily(t) × random(t)

**Admission Control Models**: Determine whether to accept new service requests:

Accept request if: Σᵢ (λᵢ × resource_demandᵢ) + λ_new × resource_demand_new ≤ capacity × safety_factor

Blocking probability: P_block = (ρᴺ/N!) / Σₖ₌₀ᴺ (ρᵏ/k!)
Where ρ = λ/μ is traffic intensity and N is system capacity.

**Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Adapt resources based on changing demands:

Proportional fair allocation: maximize Σᵢ log(R_i)
Where R_i is allocated rate to user i.

Weighted fair queueing: R_i = (w_i / Σⱼ w_j) × C_total
Where w_i is weight for user i and C_total is total capacity.
