### Part 1: Mathematical Foundations (45 minutes)

#### 1.1 Formal Definitions and Model (15 min)

**The Distributed System Model**

To understand CAP theorem rigorously, we must first establish a precise mathematical model of distributed systems. This isn't just academic - these definitions directly impact how we design and reason about real systems.

```
Distributed System Model:
- Set of processes P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} where n ≥ 2
- Each process has local state sᵢ ∈ S
- Global system state S_global = s₁ × s₂ × ... × sₙ
- Network N enabling message passing between processes
- Clients C that can read/write data items
```

**Consistency - The Mathematical Definition**

Consistency in CAP is specifically **linearizability** - the strongest form of consistency. Here's why this matters and what it really means:

```
Linearizability Definition:
A history H is linearizable if:
1. ∃ sequential history S such that:
   - S preserves the partial order of non-overlapping operations in H
   - S respects the specification of each object
2. For concurrent operations, there exists a linearization point
   within the operation's time interval

Formally: ∀ operations op₁, op₂:
  if op₁ finishes before op₂ starts in real-time
  then op₁ appears before op₂ in linearization S
```

This isn't just theoretical - linearizability determines what guarantees your users get:

```python
# Linearizable (Strong Consistency)
# Timeline: [--write(x=1)--] [--read(x)→1--]
# Guarantee: If write completes before read starts, read sees write

# Non-linearizable but sequentially consistent
# Node1: write(x=1) write(x=2)
# Node2: read(x)→2   read(x)→1  # Violates real-time ordering
```

**Availability - Beyond Simple Uptime**

CAP's availability isn't just "system responds" - it's **every non-failing node responds to every request**:

```
CAP Availability Definition:
∀ request r from client c to non-failing node n:
  n must respond to r in finite time
  (regardless of network state)

This means:
- Cannot refuse requests due to network issues
- Cannot timeout waiting for other nodes  
- Must respond based only on local state
```

This is much stronger than typical "99.9% uptime" availability:

```python
# CAP Available (must respond)
def read_request():
    return local_data  # Always responds
    
# Not CAP Available (can timeout)  
def read_request():
    try:
        consensus_value = get_consensus_value(timeout=5s)
        return consensus_value
    except TimeoutError:
        raise ServiceUnavailable  # Violates CAP availability
```

**Partition Tolerance - The Inevitable Reality**

Partition tolerance means the system continues operating when network splits occur. This isn't optional in distributed systems - partitions are inevitable.

```
Partition Model:
Network N can be partitioned into disjoint sets:
N₁, N₂, ..., Nₖ such that:
- N₁ ∪ N₂ ∪ ... ∪ Nₖ = N
- Nᵢ ∩ Nⱼ = ∅ for i ≠ j
- Nodes in different partitions cannot communicate

Partition Tolerance:
System continues to operate correctly 
in each partition Nᵢ
```

Real-world partition scenarios:

```yaml
Partition Types:
  Network Split: "Datacenter connectivity lost"
  Switch Failure: "Top-of-rack switch dies"  
  Routing Issues: "BGP convergence problems"
  Congestion: "Network saturated, packets dropped"
  Geographic: "Submarine cable cut"
  
Duration Range:
  Micro-partitions: 10ms - 1s (TCP retransmits)
  Short partitions: 1s - 30s (routing convergence)
  Long partitions: 30s - hours (cable repairs)
```

#### 1.2 The Impossibility Proof (20 min)

**Gilbert & Lynch Proof (2002)**

The formal proof is surprisingly elegant. Here's the complete argument with intuitive explanations:

```
Theorem: It is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously 
provide Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

Proof by Contradiction:

Assumptions:
1. Assume system S provides C + A + P
2. System has at least 2 nodes: {G₁, G₂}
3. Both nodes are non-failing
4. Network partition separates G₁ and G₂
```

**Step 1: Partition Scenario Construction**

```
Initial State: Both G₁ and G₂ have data item x = v₀

Network Configuration:
G₁ ←—(partition)—→ G₂
│                    │  
│                    │
Client₁           Client₂
```

**Step 2: Write Operation**

```
1. Client₁ sends write(x = v₁) to G₁
2. By Availability: G₁ must respond (cannot wait for G₂)
3. By Consistency: Write must be atomic and immediate
4. G₁ updates local state: x = v₁
5. G₁ responds success to Client₁
```

**Step 3: Read Operation**

```  
1. Client₂ sends read(x) to G₂
2. By Availability: G₂ must respond (cannot wait for G₁)
3. G₂'s local state still has x = v₀
4. By Partition: G₁ cannot communicate update to G₂
```

**Step 4: Contradiction**

```
Consistency requires: All reads return most recent write
- Most recent write was x = v₁
- G₂ can only return x = v₀ (hasn't seen update)
- Therefore: System violates Consistency

Conclusion: C + A + P is impossible
```

**Why This Proof is Profound**

The proof reveals that the conflict isn't about implementation complexity - it's mathematically fundamental:

```python
# The impossible system would need:
class ImpossibleSystem:
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Consistency: Update must be atomic across all nodes
        for node in all_nodes:
            node.update(key, value)  # But partition prevents this!
        return "success"  # Availability: Must respond
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Consistency: Must return latest write
        latest_value = get_consensus_value(key)  # But partition prevents this!
        return latest_value  # Availability: Must respond
```

**Alternative Proof via Consensus Reduction**

CAP can also be proven by reduction to consensus impossibility:

```
Consistency during partition ⟺ Consensus on write order
FLP Impossibility ⟹ Consensus impossible with failures
Network partition ⟹ Consensus impossible
Therefore: Consistency + Availability + Partition impossible
```

#### 1.3 Boundary Conditions and Edge Cases (10 min)

**When CAP Doesn't Apply**

Understanding the boundaries is crucial for practical application:

```yaml
CAP Doesn't Apply When:
  Single Node: "No distribution = no partition concerns"
  Synchronous Network: "Bounded delays enable timeouts" 
  Read-Only Workload: "No consistency conflicts possible"
  Commutative Operations: "Order doesn't matter"
  Monotonic Data: "Only additions, no conflicts"
```

**The Granularity Question**

CAP applies differently at different granularities:

```python
# Per-operation CAP choice
class TunableSystem:
    def write(self, key, value, consistency='strong'):
        if consistency == 'strong':
            return self.cp_write(key, value)  # CP operation
        else:
            return self.ap_write(key, value)  # AP operation
            
    def read(self, key, consistency='eventual'):
        if consistency == 'strong':
            return self.cp_read(key)  # CP operation  
        else:
            return self.ap_read(key)  # AP operation
```

**Temporal Aspects**

CAP is about the fundamental limits during partitions, not normal operation:

```
CAP Timeline:
├─ Normal Operation ─┤── Partition ──┤─ Healed ─┤
   (Can have C+A+P)     (Choose C or A)   (C+A+P)
   
During partition: Must choose C or A
Outside partition: Can have both C and A
```

### Part 2: Implementation Analysis (60 minutes)

#### 2.1 CP Systems - Consistency + Partition Tolerance (20 min)

**Design Principles**

CP systems prioritize correctness over availability. When network partitions occur, they refuse requests rather than risk inconsistency.

```yaml
CP System Characteristics:
  During Partition:
    - Nodes in minority partition reject writes/reads
    - Only majority partition remains available
    - Guarantees linearizability always
  
  Trade-offs:
    - Higher latency (consensus overhead)
    - Lower availability (partition failures)
    - Stronger guarantees (never incorrect)
```

**MongoDB CP Implementation**

MongoDB's replica sets demonstrate classic CP behavior:

```python
# MongoDB CP behavior during partition
class MongoReplicaSet:
    def write(self, document):
        if not self.has_majority_nodes():
            raise NotWritableSecondary("No primary - partition detected")
            
        # Write to primary, wait for majority acknowledgment
        ack_count = self.primary.write_with_acknowledgments(
            document, 
            write_concern={'w': 'majority', 'j': True}
        )
        
        if ack_count < self.majority_size:
            raise WriteConcernError("Couldn't reach majority")
        
        return WriteResult(acknowledged=True)
    
    def read(self, query, read_concern='majority'):
        if read_concern == 'majority':
            if not self.has_majority_nodes():
                raise NotReadableSecondary("No majority - partition detected")
        
        return self.execute_read_with_concern(query, read_concern)
```

**Real-world CP behavior:**

```yaml
Partition Scenario: 5-node MongoDB replica set split 2|3

Group 1 (2 nodes): 
  - No longer majority
  - Primary steps down automatically
  - All reads/writes rejected
  - State: "Secondary nodes, no primary"
  
Group 2 (3 nodes):
  - Has majority 
  - Elects new primary
  - Continues serving reads/writes
  - State: "Primary + 2 secondaries"

Result: 
  - Consistency: ✓ (only one group accepts writes)
  - Availability: ✗ (40% of nodes unavailable)
  - Partition Tolerance: ✓ (majority group continues)
```

**ZooKeeper CP Implementation**

ZooKeeper's design showcases extreme CP characteristics:

```python
class ZooKeeperEnsemble:
    def write(self, path, data):
        """ZooKeeper write - requires majority consensus"""
        if not self.is_leader():
            raise NotLeaderException("Redirect to leader")
            
        # Phase 1: Propose to all followers
        proposal_id = self.next_zxid()
        votes = self.broadcast_proposal(proposal_id, path, data)
        
        # Phase 2: Commit only if majority agrees  
        if votes >= self.majority_size:
            self.broadcast_commit(proposal_id)
            self.local_commit(path, data)
            return WriteSuccess(zxid=proposal_id)
        else:
            raise QuorumLostException("Lost majority during write")
    
    def read(self, path):
        """ZooKeeper read - local read with session consistency"""
        if not self.is_connected_to_majority():
            raise SessionExpiredException("Partition detected")
            
        return self.local_read(path)
```

**CP System Performance Implications**

```python
# Latency analysis for CP writes
import time
import statistics

def measure_cp_write_latency():
    """CP systems have higher write latency due to consensus"""
    
    # Phases of CP write
    times = {
        'propose': [],      # Broadcast proposal to all nodes
        'acknowledge': [],   # Wait for majority acknowledgments  
        'commit': [],       # Broadcast commit decision
        'total': []         # End-to-end latency
    }
    
    for attempt in range(1000):
        start = time.time()
        
        # Phase 1: Propose (network round-trip)
        propose_start = time.time()
        broadcast_proposal()  # O(n) messages
        propose_time = time.time() - propose_start
        times['propose'].append(propose_time)
        
        # Phase 2: Wait for majority (network delay)
        ack_start = time.time()
        wait_for_majority_acks()  # Max of majority response times
        ack_time = time.time() - ack_start
        times['acknowledge'].append(ack_time)
        
        # Phase 3: Commit (network round-trip)
        commit_start = time.time()
        broadcast_commit()  # O(n) messages
        commit_time = time.time() - commit_start
        times['commit'].append(commit_time)
        
        total_time = time.time() - start
        times['total'].append(total_time)
    
    # Analysis
    results = {}
    for phase, measurements in times.items():
        results[phase] = {
            'mean': statistics.mean(measurements),
            'p95': statistics.quantiles(measurements, n=20)[18],
            'p99': statistics.quantiles(measurements, n=100)[98],
        }
    
    return results

# Typical results for 5-node cluster across datacenters:
# propose:     mean=15ms, p95=45ms, p99=120ms
# acknowledge: mean=25ms, p95=80ms, p99=200ms  
# commit:      mean=15ms, p95=45ms, p99=120ms
# total:       mean=55ms, p95=170ms, p99=440ms
```

#### 2.2 AP Systems - Availability + Partition Tolerance (20 min)

**Design Philosophy**

AP systems prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency. They always respond to requests, even if the response might be stale or conflicting.

```yaml
AP System Characteristics:
  During Partition:
    - All nodes continue accepting reads/writes
    - Conflicts may occur (resolved later)
    - Eventual consistency when partition heals
  
  Trade-offs:
    - Lower latency (no consensus needed)
    - Higher availability (all nodes responsive)
    - Eventual consistency (temporary inconsistency)
```

**Amazon DynamoDB AP Implementation**

DynamoDB exemplifies AP system design with tunable consistency:

```python
class DynamoDBNode:
    def __init__(self, node_id, ring_position):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.ring_position = ring_position
        self.data_store = {}
        self.vector_clock = VectorClock()
        self.preference_list = []  # N nodes for this key range
    
    def put(self, key, value, consistency_level='ONE'):
        """AP write - always succeeds locally"""
        
        # Generate new vector clock version
        self.vector_clock.increment(self.node_id)
        versioned_value = {
            'value': value,
            'vector_clock': self.vector_clock.copy(),
            'timestamp': time.time()
        }
        
        # Write locally first (always succeeds)
        self.local_write(key, versioned_value)
        
        # Attempt to replicate to N-1 other nodes
        replicas_written = 1  # This node
        for replica_node in self.get_preference_list(key)[1:]:
            try:
                replica_node.replicate_write(key, versioned_value, timeout=1)
                replicas_written += 1
            except NetworkError:
                # AP: Continue despite failures
                self.log_hinted_handoff(replica_node, key, versioned_value)
        
        # AP: Return success even if only written locally
        return WriteResponse(
            success=True,
            replicas_written=replicas_written,
            consistency_achieved=replicas_written >= self.write_quorum_size
        )
    
    def get(self, key, consistency_level='ONE'):
        """AP read - returns best effort result"""
        
        if consistency_level == 'ONE':
            # Return local value immediately
            local_value = self.local_read(key)
            return ReadResponse(value=local_value, consistent=False)
            
        elif consistency_level == 'QUORUM':
            # Read from multiple replicas, resolve conflicts
            responses = []
            responses.append(self.local_read(key))
            
            # Best effort read from other replicas
            for replica_node in self.get_preference_list(key)[1:]:
                try:
                    replica_value = replica_node.read(key, timeout=100)
                    responses.append(replica_value)
                except NetworkError:
                    # AP: Continue despite failures
                    continue
            
            # Resolve conflicts using vector clocks
            resolved_value = self.resolve_conflicts(responses)
            return ReadResponse(
                value=resolved_value,
                consistent=len(responses) >= self.read_quorum_size
            )
```

**Cassandra AP Implementation**

Cassandra's design shows how AP systems handle the inevitable conflicts:

```python
class CassandraNode:
    def write(self, key, column, value, consistency_level):
        """Write with timestamp-based conflict resolution"""
        
        timestamp = self.get_write_timestamp()  # Microsecond precision
        mutation = Mutation(key, column, value, timestamp)
        
        # Write locally (never fails)
        self.local_storage.write(mutation)
        
        # Replicate based on consistency level
        target_nodes = self.get_replicas(key)
        if consistency_level == 'ONE':
            required_acks = 1  # Already have local write
            timeout = 10  # Very short timeout
        elif consistency_level == 'QUORUM':
            required_acks = (self.replication_factor // 2) + 1
            timeout = 2000  # Longer timeout
        elif consistency_level == 'ALL':
            required_acks = self.replication_factor
            timeout = 10000  # Very long timeout
            
        acks_received = 1  # Local write always succeeds
        for replica in target_nodes:
            try:
                replica.write_replica(mutation, timeout=timeout)
                acks_received += 1
                if acks_received >= required_acks:
                    break
            except TimeoutError:
                # AP: Don't fail the write, store as hint
                self.store_hint(replica, mutation)
        
        # Return success even if we didn't reach consistency level
        return WriteResult(
            success=True,
            consistency_level_achieved=acks_received >= required_acks
        )
    
    def resolve_read_conflicts(self, columns):
        """Last-write-wins conflict resolution"""
        if not columns:
            return None
            
        # Sort by timestamp (last write wins)
        latest_column = max(columns, key=lambda c: c.timestamp)
        
        # Handle tombstones (deletions)
        if latest_column.is_tombstone():
            # Check if any writes happened after delete
            non_tombstone_columns = [c for c in columns if not c.is_tombstone()]
            if non_tombstone_columns:
                latest_write = max(non_tombstone_columns, key=lambda c: c.timestamp)
                if latest_write.timestamp > latest_column.timestamp:
                    return latest_write
            return None  # Deleted
            
        return latest_column
```

**AP Conflict Resolution Strategies**

```python
# Vector Clock Based Resolution (DynamoDB style)
class VectorClockResolver:
    def resolve(self, conflicting_versions):
        """Returns all concurrent versions for client resolution"""
        
        concurrent_versions = []
        for version in conflicting_versions:
            is_concurrent = True
            for other_version in conflicting_versions:

                        break
            if is_concurrent:
                concurrent_versions.append(version)

                some_strictly_less = True
        
        return all_less_equal and some_strictly_less

# Timestamp Based Resolution (Cassandra style)

#### 2.3 CA Systems and the Single-Node Trap (20 min)

**The CA Illusion**

Many developers think their traditional database is "CA" - consistent and available. This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of CAP theorem.

```python
# This is NOT a CA system - it's a single-node system
class TraditionalDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
        self.transaction_log = []
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        # ACID transaction
        with self.begin_transaction():
            self.validate_constraints(key, value)
            self.write_to_log(Operation('WRITE', key, value))
            self.data[key] = value
            self.commit()
        return WriteResult(success=True)
    
    def read(self, key):
        return self.data.get(key)

# What happens when we try to make this "distributed"?
class NaiveDistributedDatabase:
    def __init__(self, nodes):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.primary = nodes[0]
        self.replicas = nodes[1:]
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write to primary
        self.primary.write(key, value)
        
        # Synchronously replicate to all replicas
        for replica in self.replicas:
            replica.write(key, value)  # What if this fails due to partition?
            
        return WriteResult(success=True)
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Read from primary for consistency
        return self.primary.read(key)  # What if primary is partitioned?
```

**The Partition Reality**

When we try to distribute a "CA" system, we immediately hit CAP constraints:

```python
class RealDistributedDatabase:
    def write(self, key, value):
        try:
            # Try to maintain consistency across all nodes
            for node in self.all_nodes:
                node.write_with_timeout(key, value, timeout=5000)
            return WriteResult(success=True, consistent=True)
            
        except PartitionError:
            # Now we must choose: Consistency OR Availability
            
            if self.mode == 'CP':
                # Choose consistency - reject write
                raise ServiceUnavailable("Cannot ensure consistency during partition")
                
            elif self.mode == 'AP':  
                # Choose availability - accept write locally
                self.local_node.write(key, value)
                self.pending_replications.append((key, value))
                return WriteResult(success=True, consistent=False)
```

**Single-Point-of-Failure Anti-Pattern**

Many systems claim to be "CA" but are actually single points of failure:

```python
# Anti-pattern: Master-slave with no failover
class MasterSlaveDatabase:
    def __init__(self, master, slaves):
        self.master = master
        self.slaves = slaves
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # All writes go to master
        result = self.master.write(key, value)
        
        # Asynchronously replicate to slaves
        for slave in self.slaves:
            try:
                slave.replicate(key, value)
            except NetworkError:
                # Ignore slave failures - NOT partition tolerant!
                pass
        
        return result
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Reads can go to slaves (eventual consistency)
        # But what if master fails? System becomes unavailable!
        if self.master.is_healthy():
            return self.master.read(key)
        else:
            # Not partition tolerant - cannot promote slave safely
            raise ServiceUnavailable("Master is down")
```

**Proper Master-Slave with Failover**

```python
class PartitionTolerantMasterSlave:
    def __init__(self, nodes, consensus_service):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.consensus = consensus_service
        self.current_master = None
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        master = self.get_current_master()
        if not master:
            # CP choice: No master = no writes
            raise NoMasterAvailable("Cannot write without master")
        
        try:
            result = master.write(key, value)
            self.replicate_to_slaves(key, value)
            return result
        except PartitionError:
            # Master may be partitioned
            if self.can_elect_new_master():
                new_master = self.elect_new_master()
                return new_master.write(key, value)
            else:
                # CP choice: Cannot ensure single master
                raise ServiceUnavailable("Cannot maintain single master")
    
    def get_current_master(self):
        # Use consensus service to determine master
        try:
            master_id = self.consensus.get_leader(timeout=1000)
            return self.nodes[master_id]
        except ConsensusTimeout:
            # CP choice: No consensus = no operations
            return None
    
    def elect_new_master(self):
        # Requires majority consensus - CP behavior
        if self.has_majority():
            return self.consensus.elect_leader()
        else:
            raise InsufficientNodes("Need majority for leader election")
```

### Part 3: Production Examples and Trade-off Analysis (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 Google Spanner - Redefining the CAP Space (10 min)

**The Spanner Challenge to CAP**

Google Spanner appears to violate CAP by providing strong consistency AND high availability across global partitions. How is this possible?

```python
class SpannerArchitecture:
    """Spanner's approach to seemingly bypass CAP"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.truetime = TrueTimeAPI()  # Hardware-based global clock
        self.paxos_groups = []  # Multiple Paxos groups for scalability
        self.global_directory = DirectoryService()
        
    def write(self, key, value):
        """Spanner write with external consistency"""
        
        # Step 1: Acquire timestamp from TrueTime
        commit_timestamp = self.truetime.now()
        uncertainty_interval = self.truetime.uncertainty()
        
        # Step 2: Determine which Paxos group owns this key
        paxos_group = self.global_directory.find_group(key)
        
        # Step 3: Use Paxos for consensus within group
        transaction = Transaction(
            operations=[WriteOperation(key, value)],
            timestamp=commit_timestamp
        )
        
        try:
            result = paxos_group.commit_transaction(transaction)
            
            # Step 4: Wait out clock uncertainty before committing
            self.wait_for_safe_time(commit_timestamp + uncertainty_interval)
            
            return WriteResult(
                success=True,
                timestamp=commit_timestamp,
                consistent=True
            )
            
        except PaxosFailure:
            # CP behavior: Cannot commit without consensus
            raise TransactionAborted("Paxos consensus failed")
    
    def read(self, key, consistency='strong'):
        """Spanner read with timestamp ordering"""
        
        if consistency == 'strong':
            # Strong consistency read
            read_timestamp = self.truetime.now_latest()
            paxos_group = self.global_directory.find_group(key)
            
            # Must wait for safe time to ensure external consistency
            self.wait_for_safe_time(read_timestamp)
            
            return paxos_group.read_at_timestamp(key, read_timestamp)
            
        elif consistency == 'stale':
            # Stale read - can read from any replica
            # Much faster but potentially stale
            local_replica = self.find_nearest_replica(key)
            return local_replica.read_latest(key)
```

**Why Spanner Doesn't Actually Violate CAP**

Spanner makes specific assumptions that allow it to appear to violate CAP:

```yaml
Spanner's Assumptions:
  Network Partitions:
    - Google's private network has extremely low partition rates
    - When partitions occur, minority partitions DO become unavailable
    - Not truly "partition tolerant" in CAP sense
  
  TrueTime Requirements:
    - GPS and atomic clocks in each datacenter
    - Bounded clock uncertainty (typically 1-7ms)
    - If clocks fail, system stops accepting writes (CP behavior)
  
  Operational Context:
    - Google controls entire network stack
    - Massive engineering investment in infrastructure reliability
    - Can afford to make entire regions unavailable during major partitions
```

```python
class TrueTimeImplementation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gps_clocks = [GPSClock() for _ in range(4)]  # Redundant GPS
        self.atomic_clocks = [AtomicClock() for _ in range(4)]  # Redundant atomic
        
    def now(self):
        """Returns time interval [earliest, latest] due to uncertainty"""
        gps_times = [gps.now() for gps in self.gps_clocks if gps.is_healthy()]
        atomic_times = [atomic.now() for atomic in self.atomic_clocks if atomic.is_healthy()]
        
        if not gps_times and not atomic_times:
            # CP behavior: Cannot provide time guarantees
            raise ClockFailure("All time sources failed - stopping writes")
        
        all_times = gps_times + atomic_times
        uncertainty = self.calculate_uncertainty(all_times)
        best_estimate = statistics.median(all_times)
        
        return TimeInterval(
            earliest=best_estimate - uncertainty,
            latest=best_estimate + uncertainty
        )
    
    def wait_for_safe_time(self, target_time):
        """Wait until we're sure target_time has passed globally"""
        current_interval = self.now()
        if current_interval.latest < target_time:
            sleep_time = target_time - current_interval.latest
            time.sleep(sleep_time / 1000.0)  # Convert ms to seconds

#### 3.2 DynamoDB - Tunable CAP Trade-offs (10 min)

#### 3.3 Cassandra - AP System Architecture (10 min)

**Cassandra's AP Design Philosophy**

Cassandra is designed as a pure AP system that provides tunable consistency:

```python
class CassandraCluster:
    """Cassandra's AP-first architecture"""
    
    def __init__(self, nodes, replication_factor=3):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.replication_factor = replication_factor
        self.token_ring = ConsistentHashRing(nodes)
        
    def write(self, keyspace, table, key, columns, consistency_level='ONE'):

### Part 4: Modern CAP Extensions and Alternatives (15 minutes)

#### 4.1 PACELC Extension (5 min)

**Beyond CAP: The PACELC Framework**

PACELC (pronounced "pass-elk") extends CAP by considering latency during normal operation:

```
PACELC Framework:
If Partition (P): Choose Availability (A) or Consistency (C)
Else (E): Choose Latency (L) or Consistency (C)

This creates four system categories:
- PC/EL: Partition→Consistency, Normal→Latency
- PC/EC: Partition→Consistency, Normal→Consistency  
- PA/EL: Partition→Availability, Normal→Latency
- PA/EC: Partition→Availability, Normal→Consistency
```

```python

    def __init__(self, partition_policy, normal_policy):
