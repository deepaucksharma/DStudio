**Viewstamped Replication: The Pioneer**

Viewstamped Replication (VR) was developed by Brian Oki and Barbara Liskov at MIT in 1988, predating Paxos by nearly a decade. It was the first protocol to solve state machine replication with a practical, understandable approach.

**The View-Based Protocol**

Viewstamped Replication organizes the system around views, where each view has a designated primary that coordinates operations.

```python

        # VR state
        self.view_number = 0
        self.op_number = 0

## Key Takeaways

1. **Historical Importance**: VR pioneered state machine replication and influenced all modern consensus algorithms
2. **Integrated Design**: VR provides complete solution including recovery and state transfer, not just consensus
3. **View Abstraction**: Views provide clean abstraction for handling failures and leader changes
4. **Modern Relevance**: VR concepts are embedded in Raft, Chain Replication, and other modern systems
5. **Practical Focus**: VR was designed for real systems from the start, making it practical and deployable
