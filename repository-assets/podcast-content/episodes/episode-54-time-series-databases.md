## Section 1: Theoretical Foundations (45 minutes)

### Mathematical Foundations of Temporal Data Models

Time-series databases operate on mathematical foundations that explicitly embrace the temporal dimension as a first-class organizing principle for data management. The formal representation of time-series data can be expressed as a mapping from time points to multidimensional data vectors, where the temporal ordering provides both organizational structure and query optimization opportunities that are unique among data management systems.

The fundamental mathematical structure of a time-series can be formally defined as a function T: ℝ → ℝⁿ, where T maps from the real-valued time domain to n-dimensional measurement vectors. In practical implementations, this continuous mathematical abstraction is discretized into time-stamped data points that can be represented as tuples (timestamp, metric_values, metadata), where each tuple represents a single observation in the temporal sequence.

The temporal ordering property of time-series data provides mathematical structure that enables powerful optimizations not available in other data models. The total ordering of timestamps creates a natural partitioning dimension that can be exploited for efficient storage, indexing, and query processing. Unlike arbitrary key-value or document data where ordering is imposed artificially, time-series data has inherent ordering that reflects the causal structure of the underlying phenomena being measured.

Interpolation and extrapolation represent fundamental mathematical operations in time-series analysis that must be supported efficiently by time-series database systems. The mathematical foundations involve understanding how to estimate values at arbitrary time points based on neighboring observations, using techniques ranging from simple linear interpolation to sophisticated spline fitting and predictive modeling algorithms.

Sampling theory provides the mathematical foundation for understanding how continuous temporal phenomena can be adequately represented through discrete observations. The Nyquist theorem and related sampling theorems establish fundamental limits on the sampling rates required to accurately capture temporal signals with specific frequency characteristics. Time-series databases must understand these mathematical constraints when designing storage and compression strategies.

The mathematical analysis of time-series data often involves frequency domain representations through Fourier transforms and wavelet analysis. Time-series databases must efficiently support both time-domain and frequency-domain queries, requiring storage and indexing strategies that can handle both temporal locality and spectral analysis requirements.

Aggregation operations over time-series data have unique mathematical properties due to the temporal ordering. Rolling aggregations, sliding window computations, and temporal grouping operations can exploit the ordered nature of the data to provide efficient incremental computation strategies that are not available in non-temporal data systems.

### Temporal Consistency Models and Ordering Guarantees

The theoretical foundations of consistency in time-series databases must address the unique challenges posed by high-velocity data ingestion, temporal ordering requirements, and the need for both real-time and historical data access patterns. Traditional consistency models developed for general-purpose databases must be adapted to handle the specific characteristics of temporal data streams.

Temporal consistency extends traditional consistency models to provide guarantees about the ordering and visibility of time-series data points. The mathematical foundation involves understanding how to maintain the temporal ordering invariant across distributed systems while allowing for high-throughput data ingestion from multiple concurrent sources. This requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms that can resolve timestamp conflicts and maintain causal ordering.

Event-time versus processing-time consistency represents a fundamental theoretical challenge in distributed time-series systems. Event-time refers to when an event actually occurred in the real world, while processing-time refers to when the system processes the event. The mathematical framework must handle the reality that events may arrive out-of-order due to network delays, system failures, or distributed processing latencies.

Watermark-based consistency provides a mathematical framework for reasoning about completeness in time-series streams where data may arrive with significant delays. Watermarks represent lower bounds on the event-time of future arrivals, enabling systems to reason about when it is safe to produce results for specific time windows. The mathematical analysis involves understanding how watermark propagation interacts with distributed processing and fault tolerance requirements.

Causal consistency becomes particularly important in time-series systems where the temporal relationships between measurements may reflect underlying physical or logical causality relationships. The mathematical foundation must provide mechanisms for ensuring that causally related measurements are processed in the correct order while allowing independent measurements to be processed concurrently.

Eventual consistency models for time-series data must address how late-arriving data should be integrated into existing time-series while maintaining query consistency. The mathematical framework must handle scenarios where historical data is revised or corrected, potentially affecting previously computed aggregations and analytical results.

Session consistency in time-series contexts ensures that individual data producers observe their own writes in the correct temporal order, even if the global ordering across all producers may be relaxed. This consistency model is particularly relevant for monitoring and alerting systems where individual producers need to observe the effects of their own data submissions immediately.
