## Part 1: Mathematical Foundations (45 minutes)

### 1.1 Theoretical Background (15 min)

Linearizability is the strongest consistency model in distributed systems, requiring that all operations appear to execute atomically at some point between their invocation and response. Introduced by Herlihy and Wing in 1990, it extends the concept of atomic consistency from concurrent programming to distributed systems.

**Formal Definition**: A history H is linearizable if there exists a total order ≺ on the operations in H such that:
1. If operation op₁ completes before operation op₂ begins, then op₁ ≺ op₂ (real-time ordering)
2. Each read operation returns the value written by the most recent write in ≺

This seemingly simple definition has profound implications for distributed system design and performance.

**Key Properties**:
- **Atomicity**: Operations appear instantaneous
- **Real-time ordering**: Respects physical time constraints  
- **Sequential specification**: Matches expected sequential behavior
- **Compositionality**: Linearizable objects compose to form linearizable systems

### 1.2 Proofs and Derivations (20 min)

**Theorem 1**: Linearizability implies sequential consistency but not vice versa.

**Proof**: Let H be a linearizable history with linearization order ≺. For any process P, if op₁ precedes op₂ in P's program order, then either:
1. op₁ completes before op₂ begins (real-time constraint), so op₁ ≺ op₂
2. op₁ and op₂ overlap, but ≺ must still respect program order

Since ≺ respects both real-time and program order, H satisfies sequential consistency requirements.

The converse is false: consider this history where processes see different orders:
```
P1: write(x, 1)
P2: write(x, 2) 
P3: read(x) → 1, read(x) → 2
P4: read(x) → 2, read(x) → 1
```

This is sequentially consistent (each process sees a valid total order) but not linearizable (violates real-time ordering).

**Theorem 2**: Linearizability is equivalent to the existence of a linearization witness.

A linearization witness for operation op is a point t such that:
- op is active at time t (start ≤ t ≤ end)
- All operations with witness t' < t precede op in specification
- All operations with witness t' > t follow op in specification

**Proof Construction**: Given linearizable history H, construct witness function w: ops(H) → ℝ such that w respects the linearization order. Conversely, given valid witness function, the induced order proves linearizability.

**Theorem 3**: Impossibility of wait-free linearizable consensus.

This follows from the FLP impossibility result: in an asynchronous system with one faulty process, deterministic consensus is impossible. Since linearizable registers can implement consensus, wait-free linearizable consensus is also impossible.

### 1.3 Complexity Analysis (10 min)

**Time Complexity**:
- Single-object operations: O(n) message complexity for n replicas
- Multi-object operations: O(n²) due to coordination requirements
- Read operations can be optimized to O(1) with lease-based schemes

**Space Complexity**:
- O(log n) space per operation for logical timestamps
- O(n) space for maintaining replica state consistency
- Unbounded space in worst case due to pending operations

**Verification Complexity**:
- Linearizability checking is NP-complete for finite histories
- Wing and Gong's algorithm: O(n!) worst-case exponential
- Modern approaches use constraint solving: O(2^n) typical case

**etcd: Linearizable Configuration Store**

etcd provides linearizable reads and writes for Kubernetes cluster configuration. Key implementation details:

- **Raft Consensus**: Uses Raft for log replication and leader election
- **Linearizable Reads**: Leader serves reads after confirming leadership via heartbeat
- **MVCC Storage**: Multi-version concurrency control for efficient reads
- **Lease-based Optimization**: Reduces read latency through time-based leases

**Google Spanner: Globally Linearizable Database**

Spanner achieves global linearizability through TrueTime and synchronized clocks:

- **TrueTime API**: Bounded clock uncertainty (typically <7ms)
- **Commit Wait**: Delays commit until uncertainty passes
- **Paxos Groups**: Regional consensus for strong consistency
- **External Consistency**: Stronger than linearizability across timestamps

**MongoDB: Linearizable Read Concern**

MongoDB's "linearizable" read concern ensures operations read from primary with majority confirmation:

```javascript
// MongoDB linearizable read
db.collection.findOne(
  { _id: "document1" },
  { readConcern: { level: "linearizable" } }
)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Linearizability is the gold standard** but comes with significant performance costs
2. **Real-time ordering** is the key differentiator from sequential consistency
3. **Consensus is required** for linearizable writes in distributed systems
4. **Read optimizations** can significantly reduce latency while preserving correctness
5. **Verification is crucial** but computationally expensive for large systems

Linearizability provides the strongest consistency guarantee but requires careful consideration of performance and availability trade-offs. Use it when correctness is paramount and the performance cost is acceptable.
