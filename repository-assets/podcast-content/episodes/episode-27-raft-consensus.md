#### 1.1 Raft's Design Philosophy - Understandability First (15 min)

**The Motivation Behind Raft**

Raft was designed in 2014 by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout at Stanford specifically to address Paxos's complexity. Their key insight: if distributed systems are hard to build correctly, then the consensus algorithm at their core should be as understandable as possible.

```

#### 1.2 Raft State Machine and Term Numbers (20 min)

**The Three Server States**

Raft servers exist in exactly one of three states at any time. The clean separation of states makes the algorithm easier to understand and implement.

```python
class RaftServer:
    def __init__(self, server_id):
        self.server_id = server_id
        self.state = ServerState.FOLLOWER  # All servers start as followers
        self.current_term = 0
        self.voted_for = None
        self.log = []
        self.commit_index = 0
        self.last_applied = 0
        
        # Leader state (valid only when state == LEADER)
        self.next_index = {}  # Per-follower next log index to send
        self.match_index = {}  # Per-follower highest replicated index
        
        # Timers
        self.election_timeout = self.randomize_election_timeout()
        self.heartbeat_interval = 50  # milliseconds
    
    def state_transition_rules(self):
        """
        Valid state transitions in Raft
        Mathematical invariant: Server can be in exactly one state

        return {
            "FOLLOWER": {
                "to_candidate": "Election timeout expires without hearing from leader",
                "to_leader": "Never directly - must become candidate first",
                "stays_follower": "Receives valid RPC from leader or candidate"
            },

                "stays_candidate": "Split vote - retry election with new term"
            },
            "LEADER": {

                "to_candidate": "Never - leaders don't become candidates",
                "stays_leader": "Maintains leadership through successful heartbeats"
            }
        }

class ServerState(Enum):
    FOLLOWER = "follower"
    CANDIDATE = "candidate" 
    LEADER = "leader"
```

**Term Numbers - Raft's Logical Clock**

Terms in Raft serve as a logical clock, providing a simple way to detect stale information and ensure safety across leader changes.

```python
class TermManagement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_term = 0
        
    def term_invariants(self):
        """

            "term_comparison_rule": "Higher term always wins"
        }
    
    def handle_higher_term(self, received_term):

            return True
        return False

                "principle": "Equal terms: established leader wins"
            }
        }
```

#### 1.3 Safety Properties and Proofs (10 min)

**The Five Raft Safety Properties**

### Part 2: Leader Election Implementation (60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Election Algorithm Walkthrough (20 min)

**Randomized Timeout-Based Elections**

Raft uses randomized election timeouts to prevent split votes and ensure liveness. This is simpler than Paxos's complex leader election mechanisms.

```python
class LeaderElection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.election_timeout_range = (150, 300)  # milliseconds
        self.heartbeat_interval = 50  # milliseconds

### Part 3: Log Replication Mechanics (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 AppendEntries RPC and Log Consistency (10 min)

**The AppendEntries Protocol**

AppendEntries serves dual purposes: heartbeats (empty entries) and log replication (with entries). The consistency check ensures logs remain synchronized.

```python
class AppendEntriesRPC:
    def __init__(self, term, leader_id, prev_log_index, prev_log_term, entries, leader_commit):
        self.term = term
        self.leader_id = leader_id
        self.prev_log_index = prev_log_index  # Index of log entry immediately preceding new ones
        self.prev_log_term = prev_log_term    # Term of prev_log_index entry
        self.entries = entries                # Log entries to store (empty for heartbeat)
        self.leader_commit = leader_commit    # Leader's commit_index

class LogReplication:
    def handle_append_entries(self, request):
        """
        Follower processing of AppendEntries RPC
        """
        response = AppendEntriesResponse()
        response.term = self.current_term
        
        # Reply false if term < current_term
        if request.term < self.current_term:
            response.success = False
            return response
        
        # Update term and become follower if necessary
        if request.term > self.current_term:
            self.current_term = request.term
            self.voted_for = None
        self.state = ServerState.FOLLOWER
        self.reset_election_timeout()
        
        # Consistency check: Reply false if log doesn't contain an entry 
        # at prev_log_index whose term matches prev_log_term
        if request.prev_log_index >= len(self.log):
            response.success = False
            return response
        
        if (request.prev_log_index >= 0 and 
            request.prev_log_index < len(self.log) and
            self.log[request.prev_log_index].term != request.prev_log_term):
            response.success = False
            return response
        
        # If an existing entry conflicts with a new one (same index but different terms),
        # delete the existing entry and all that follow it
        for i, new_entry in enumerate(request.entries):
            log_index = request.prev_log_index + 1 + i
            
            if log_index < len(self.log):
                if self.log[log_index].term != new_entry.term:
                    # Delete this entry and all following entries
                    self.log = self.log[:log_index]
                    break

            self.commit_index = min(request.leader_commit, len(self.log) - 1)
        
        response.success = True
        return response
```

#### 3.2 Commit Index Management and Safety (10 min)

**Commitment Rules and Safety**

Raft's commitment rules ensure that once a log entry is committed, it will never be lost, even across leader changes.

```python
class CommitIndexManagement:
    def leader_commit_advancement(self):
        """
        Leader advances commit index when majority has replicated an entry
        """

            for server_id in self.cluster_members:
                if server_id != self.server_id:
                    if self.match_index[server_id] >= index:
                        replicated_count += 1
            
            # Check if majority has replicated this entry
            if replicated_count > len(self.cluster_members) // 2:
                # Additional safety check: only commit entries from current term
                if self.log[index].term == self.current_term:
                    self.commit_index = index

                    # Cannot commit entries from previous terms directly
                    # Must wait for current term entry to be committed
                    break
            else:
                break  # If index i not committed, higher indices can't be either
    
    def commit_safety_invariant(self):
        """

            "rule": "Leader only commits log entries from its current term",

```

#### 3.3 Follower Recovery and Backtracking (10 min)

**Handling Inconsistent Followers**

When followers have inconsistent logs (due to crashes or network partitions), the leader must bring them back to consistency through backtracking.

```python
class FollowerRecovery:
    def handle_append_entries_failure(self, follower_id, failed_request):
        """
        When AppendEntries fails, backtrack to find point of consistency

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Mathematical correctness verified through Raft safety properties
- [ ] Code examples tested with distributed system simulation
- [ ] Production examples validated against etcd, CockroachDB implementations
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly connected to consensus theory episodes
- [ ] Learning objectives measurable through implementation exercises
- [ ] Site content integrated with updated consensus patterns
- [ ] References complete with Raft paper and production case studies

## Key Takeaways

1. **Understandability Principle**: Raft's primary innovation is making consensus understandable, not faster
2. **Strong Leader Model**: Single active leader simplifies the protocol significantly compared to Paxos
3. **Term Numbers**: Simpler than Paxos proposal numbers, provide clean leader transitions
4. **Production Proven**: etcd, CockroachDB, Consul demonstrate Raft's practical effectiveness
5. **Scalability Through Sharding**: Multi-Raft architectures enable horizontal scaling while maintaining simplicity
