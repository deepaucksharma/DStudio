## Implementation Quick Start

### Library Selection Guide
| Library | Language | Best For | Performance |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| quiche | Rust | Edge servers | Highest |
| msquic | C | Windows integration | Excellent |
| mvfst | C++ | Complex applications | Very Good |
| lsquic | C | High performance | Excellent |

### Basic Implementation Example
```python
# Using aioquic
import asyncio
from aioquic.asyncio import connect

async def http3_request():
    async with connect("https://example.com", 443) as protocol:
        # 0-RTT if resumption available
        stream_id = protocol.get_next_available_stream_id()
        protocol.send_headers(stream_id, headers)
        protocol.send_data(stream_id, data, end_stream=True)
        
        # Receive response
        headers = await protocol.receive_headers(stream_id)
        data = await protocol.receive_data(stream_id)
```

## Migration Strategy Framework

### Phase 1: Evaluation (Month 1-2)
- Benchmark QUIC vs TCP in your environment
- Identify high-impact services
- Test library compatibility

### Phase 2: Pilot (Month 3-4)
- Deploy to 1% of traffic
- Monitor performance metrics
- Implement fallback mechanisms

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Month 5-6)
- Increase to 10%, then 50%
- Address edge cases
- Optimize configurations

### Phase 4: Full Deployment (Month 7+)
- Complete migration for suitable services
- Maintain TCP fallback for compatibility
- Continuous optimization

## Business Impact Analysis

### ROI Calculations
- **Performance Gains**: 25-67% latency reduction
- **Infrastructure Savings**: 15-30% from better utilization
- **User Experience**: 34% faster page loads
- **Mobile Performance**: 90% better connection recovery
- **Global Reach**: Significant improvements in emerging markets

### Investment Requirements
- **Engineering**: 3-6 months for full deployment
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal changes required
- **Training**: 2-4 weeks for team upskilling
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced observability tools

## Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Firewall/NAT Issues**: Use fallback to TCP, implement QUIC discovery
2. **Load Balancer Integration**: Use connection ID routing
3. **Debugging Complexity**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring
4. **Legacy System Support**: Implement proxy patterns
