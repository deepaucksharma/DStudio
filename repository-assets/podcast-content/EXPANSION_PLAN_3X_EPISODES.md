# Podcast Expansion Plan: From 32 to 96+ Episodes
## Deep-Dive Technical Architecture Series

## Current State Analysis
- **Current Episodes**: 32 episodes across 3 series
- **Target**: 96+ episodes (3x expansion)
- **Focus**: Deep technical detail, real-world scenarios, tradeoffs, alternatives

## Core Expansion Philosophy
Based on your example's engaging style, each major concept should be broken into:
1. **Mathematical/Physics Foundation** (why it's impossible to avoid)
2. **Real-World Failures** (with dollar costs and timelines)
3. **Detection & Measurement** (how to spot it before it kills you)
4. **Implementation Patterns** (actual code, not theory)
5. **Tradeoff Analysis** (when to use, when to avoid)
6. **Economic Modeling** (ROI calculations, break-even points)
