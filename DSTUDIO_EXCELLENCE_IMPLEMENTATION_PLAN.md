  silver: document.querySelector('#filter-silver'),
  bronze: document.querySelector('#filter-bronze')
};

// Dynamic recommendations
function recommendPattern(requirements) {
  if (requirements.distributedTransactions) {
    if (requirements.microservices) {
      return { pattern: 'Saga', tier: 'gold', 
               reason: 'Non-blocking, handles failures gracefully' };
    } else {
      return { pattern: '2PC', tier: 'bronze',
               warning: 'Consider Saga for better scalability' };
    }
  }
}
```

graph TD
    Start[Using 2PC?] --> Check{Microservices?}
    Check -->|Yes| Saga[Migrate to Saga 🏆]
    Check -->|No| Evaluate{Scale needed?}
    Evaluate -->|High| Saga
    Evaluate -->|Low| Keep[Keep 2PC with monitoring ⚠️]
    
    Saga --> Steps[Migration Steps:<br/>1. Identify transactions<br/>2. Design compensations<br/>3. Implement orchestrator<br/>4. Test failure modes]
```

**Day 47-48: Architecture Decision Records**

Create ADR templates and examples:
```markdown
# ADR-001: Migrating from 2PC to Saga Pattern

## Status
Accepted (2024-01-15)

## Context
- System: Payment processing for 1M+ daily transactions
- Problem: 2PC causing 5s p99 latency, coordinator failures block orders
- Scale: Growing 50% YoY

## Decision
Adopt Saga pattern with orchestration for distributed transactions

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Keep 2PC**: Rejected - Can't meet SLA at scale
2. **Event Choreography**: Rejected - Too complex for payment flows
3. **Saga Orchestration**: Selected - Clear flow, easier debugging
