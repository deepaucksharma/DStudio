# DStudio Content Accuracy Review Report

## Summary
This report documents content accuracy and credibility issues found in the DStudio documentation site during a systematic review conducted on 2025-07-23.

## 1. Fabricated/Unverifiable Metrics

### 1.1 Specific Numbers Without Citations

**File: `/docs/case-studies/digital-wallet-enhanced.md`**
- Line 2017: "Pending: 127 transactions" - Appears to be fabricated example data
- **Recommendation**: Add disclaimer "Example visualization" or use placeholder like "X transactions"

**File: `/docs/patterns/retry-backoff.md`**
- Lines 1345-1348: 
  - "Prevented Failures: 42,847 requests"
  - "Extra Compute Cost: $1,247" 
  - "Revenue Protected: $128,541"
  - "ROI: 10,209%"
- **Recommendation**: Add disclaimer "Example calculation based on hypothetical scenario" or cite source

**File: `/docs/part1-axioms/archive-old-8-axiom-structure/axiom8-economics/examples.md`**
- Line 68: "34,000 queries" during incident
- **Recommendation**: If this is a real incident, add citation; otherwise mark as hypothetical

### 1.2 Performance Claims Without Evidence

**File: `/docs/patterns/edge-computing.md`**
- Line 69: "AR glasses... 20ms → 5ms latency (no nausea)"
- Line 70: "Smart city traffic... 30% traffic flow improvement"
- **Recommendation**: Add "estimated" or cite studies

**File: `/docs/case-studies/amazon-dynamo.md`**
- Line 487: "DynamoDB... achieve <10ms latency"
- **Recommendation**: Add "can achieve" or cite AWS documentation

**File: `/docs/quantitative/consistency-models.md`**
- Line 49: "Amazon DynamoDB: Eventual consistency = <10ms latency, 99.999% uptime"
- **Recommendation**: Add citation to AWS SLA documentation

### 1.3 Historical Claims Needing Verification

**File: `/docs/quantitative/littles-law.md`**
- Line 43: "Amazon (2006): 100ms latency = 1% sales loss"
- Line 45: "Twitter (2010): λ=3,283 tweets/s × W=5s → L=16,415 tweets queued → Fail Whale"
- **Recommendation**: Add citations to original sources or mark as "reported" vs verified

**File: `/docs/part1-axioms/archive-old-8-axiom-structure/axiom1-latency/index.md`**
- Lines 141-142: "Amazon: Every 100ms latency → 1% sales loss" and "Google: 500ms delay → 20% traffic drop"
- Line 451-452: Repeated claims about Amazon, Google, Bing performance impacts
- **Recommendation**: These are widely cited but need original source references

## 2. Outdated Technology References

### 2.1 Version Numbers

**File: `/docs/patterns/sidecar.md`**
- Line 188: `envoyproxy/envoy:v1.22.0` (repeated on line 353)
- **Current Version**: Envoy is now at v1.31.x (as of Jan 2025)
- **Recommendation**: Update to `envoyproxy/envoy:v1.31.0` or use generic version like `envoyproxy/envoy:latest`

### 2.2 API/Service References

**File: `/docs/part1-axioms/archive-old-8-axiom-structure/axiom2-capacity/index.md`**
- Lines 368-370: API rate limits for GitHub, Twitter, Stripe
- **Recommendation**: Verify current limits and add "as of [date]" notation

## 3. Inconsistent Terminology

### 3.1 "Law" vs "Axiom" Confusion

The codebase shows a transition from an 8-axiom to 7-law framework, but inconsistent usage remains:

**File: `/docs/macros.py`**
- Line 28: Function called `law_ref` but references `axiom` in the path
- **Recommendation**: Complete migration to consistent terminology

**File: `/docs/reference/law-mapping-guide.md`**
- Title references both "Law Framework" and "8-axiom structure"
- **Recommendation**: Clarify this is a transition guide

## 4. Missing Disclaimers for Estimates

### 4.1 Performance Benchmarks

Multiple files contain specific performance numbers without indicating whether they are:
- Theoretical limits
- Best-case scenarios  
- Typical performance
- Worst-case scenarios

**Examples**:
- `/docs/patterns/service-mesh.md` Line 481: "5-10μs overhead (vs 1-2ms for sidecars)"
- `/docs/case-studies/proximity-service.md` Line 1765: "sub-200ms response times"
- `/docs/case-studies/stock-exchange.md` Line 1119: "<10μs latency impact"

**Recommendation**: Add context like "typically", "can achieve", "in optimal conditions"

## 5. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Add a global disclaimer on the site: "Performance metrics and examples are illustrative unless otherwise cited"
2. Update Envoy version references to current stable version
3. Add citations for widely-referenced performance studies (Amazon, Google, etc.)
4. Mark example/demonstration data clearly as such

### Long-term Actions
1. Establish a quarterly review process for version numbers and technology references
2. Create a citation style guide for performance claims
3. Complete the axiom-to-law terminology migration
4. Consider adding a "Last Updated" date to pages with time-sensitive information

### Documentation Standards
Propose adding these standards to CLAUDE.md:
- All performance metrics must indicate source or mark as "estimated/typical"
- Version numbers should use major version only (e.g., v1.x) or "latest" unless precision needed
- Example data in visualizations must be marked as "Example" or "Illustrative"
- Historical claims require citations or "as reported" qualifiers

## Files Requiring Most Attention

1. `/docs/patterns/retry-backoff.md` - Contains very specific uncited metrics
2. `/docs/part1-axioms/archive-old-8-axiom-structure/axiom1-latency/index.md` - Multiple uncited performance claims
3. `/docs/patterns/sidecar.md` - Outdated version numbers
4. `/docs/case-studies/digital-wallet-enhanced.md` - Example data presented as real

This review covered the requested directories and identified patterns of issues that likely exist throughout the documentation. A more comprehensive review of all documentation files is recommended.
