# Planned Features Analysis

**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Purpose:** Review all "planned features" (missing content references) to determine if they make sense

## Overview

Found 1,586 references to non-existent content across 215 files. Let's analyze each category to determine if these are sensible planned features or should be removed.

## Analysis by Category

### 1. Pattern Library (695 references) - ‚ùå SHOULD BE FIXED
**Assessment:** These are NOT planned features - they're broken references to existing patterns.

**Issue:** Links missing the category subdirectory
- `../pattern-library/event-sourcing` should be `../pattern-library/data-management/event-sourcing`
- `../pattern-library/circuit-breaker` should be `../pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker`

**Recommendation:** Fix these references, don't create new content.

### 2. "Other" Category (711 references) - üîç MIXED
Many are formatting issues, not missing content:
- `.md#anchor` links where the `.md` should be removed
- Incorrect relative paths (`../../../scenarios.md` pointing nowhere)
- Some legitimate missing content

**Recommendation:** Audit individually, fix paths where content exists.

### 3. Guides (82 references) - ‚úÖ MAKES SENSE
**Assessment:** These are legitimate planned enhancements.

**Examples:**
- "Real-Time Systems Guide"
- "Geo-Distributed Systems"
- "Mobile Optimization Playbook"

**Recommendation:** Keep as planned features or create stub pages with "Coming Soon" notices.

### 4. Quantitative Analysis (39 references) - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY MAKES SENSE
**Issue:** Some content may already exist under different names.

**Check needed:**
- Does "Latency Ladder" exist as `latency-numbers.md`?
- Is "Universal Scalability Law" covered elsewhere?

**Recommendation:** Verify if content exists under different names before creating.

### 5. Implementation Playbooks (8 references) - ‚úÖ MAKES SENSE
**Assessment:** Valuable planned content for practical guidance.

**Examples:**
- "Monolith to Microservices"
- "Zero-Downtime Migrations"
- "Multi-Region Deployment"

**Recommendation:** These would add significant value. Keep as planned features.

### 6. Templates (7 references) - ‚úÖ MAKES SENSE
**Assessment:** Practical tools for engineering leadership.

**Examples:**
- "1:1 Meeting Template"
- "Performance Review Framework"
- "Career Development Plan"

**Recommendation:** Valuable additions for the leadership section. Keep as planned.

### 7. Calculators/Tools (7 references) - ‚úÖ MAKES SENSE
**Assessment:** Interactive tools enhance learning.

**Examples:**
- "Latency Calculator"
- "CAP Theorem Calculator"

**Recommendation:** Would provide practical value. Consider implementing or linking to external tools.

### 8. Best Practices (6 references) - ‚úÖ MAKES SENSE
**Assessment:** Valuable content for leadership section.

**Examples:**
- "Remote Team Management"
- "Inclusive Leadership"
- "Burnout Prevention Playbook"

**Recommendation:** Relevant to modern engineering leadership. Keep as planned.

### 9. Case Studies (29 references) - ‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK FIRST
**Issue:** Some might already exist.

**Examples:**
- "Consistent Hashing" - Check if covered in existing case studies
- "Netflix Chaos" - May be in chaos engineering section

**Recommendation:** Audit to see if content exists elsewhere before creating.

## Summary Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Fixes Needed (~700 links)
**Pattern Library References**: These are broken links to existing content, not planned features.
```bash
# These need path fixes, not new content
../pattern-library/circuit-breaker ‚Üí ../pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker
```

### 2. Legitimate Planned Features (~300 links)
Keep these as planned enhancements:
- Implementation Playbooks
- Engineering Leadership Templates
- Interactive Calculators
- Best Practice Guides

### 3. Need Investigation (~586 links)
- Check if content exists under different names
- Verify if paths are just wrong
- Determine if truly valuable to create

## Proposed Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Broken References (1-2 days)
1. **Fix Pattern Library paths** - Add missing category directories
2. **Fix anchor links** - Remove `.md` from `file.md#anchor`
3. **Fix relative path issues** - Correct `../../../` paths

### Phase 2: Audit Existing Content (1 day)
1. **Check Quantitative Analysis** - Map to existing files
2. **Check Case Studies** - Verify what already exists
3. **Create mapping** of intended vs actual content

### Phase 3: Prioritize New Content (Planning)
1. **High Value**:
   - Implementation Playbooks
   - Interactive Calculators
   - Leadership Templates

2. **Medium Value**:
   - Additional case studies
   - Best practice guides

3. **Low Value**:
   - Duplicate content
   - Overly specific guides

## Bottom Line

**Of 1,586 "missing" links:**
- ~700 are broken references that should be fixed, not created
- ~300 are legitimate valuable planned features
- ~586 need investigation to determine the right action

**Recommendation:** Fix the broken references first, then selectively implement high-value planned features rather than trying to create all missing content.
