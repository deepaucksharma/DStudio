## Quality Analysis

### What Excellence Looks Like

**axiom1-latency/exercises.md (368 lines)** demonstrates the target quality:
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Practical code examples
- Real-world scenarios
- Debugging challenges
- Performance optimization exercises
- Cross-references to patterns

### Gap Analysis

**Current**: 15 stub files out of 16 total files
**Target**: All files 300+ lines with practical content
**Gap**: ~4,500 lines of content needed

## Content Templates

### Example File Structure (Target: 400+ lines)
```
1. Introduction (20 lines)
   - Concept recap
   - Why examples matter

2. Real-World Failures (100 lines)
   - 2-3 production incidents
   - Root cause analysis
   - Lessons learned

3. Code Examples (200 lines)
   - Basic implementation
   - Advanced patterns
   - Anti-patterns to avoid

4. Industry Case Studies (80 lines)
   - How Netflix/Google/AWS handles it
   - Trade-offs made
   - Results achieved

5. Quick Reference (20 lines)
   - Decision tree
   - Common values/thresholds
```

### Exercise File Structure (Target: 350+ lines)
```
1. Warm-up Exercises (50 lines)
   - Conceptual questions
   - Simple calculations

2. Hands-on Labs (150 lines)
   - Build it yourself
   - Measure and observe
   - Break and fix

3. Real Scenarios (100 lines)
   - Debug this production issue
   - Design this system
   - Optimize this bottleneck

4. Advanced Challenges (50 lines)
   - Research projects
   - Open-ended problems
```

## Priority Order

Based on learning path importance:

### Phase 1 (Critical Path - Week 1)
1. **Axiom 2 (Capacity)** - Foundation for scaling
2. **Axiom 3 (Failure)** - Core distributed systems concept
3. **Axiom 4 (Concurrency)** - Essential for modern systems

### Phase 2 (Important - Week 2)
4. **Axiom 5 (Coordination)** - Consensus and distributed algorithms
5. **Axiom 6 (Observability)** - Debugging distributed systems
6. **Axiom 8 (Economics)** - Cost-performance trade-offs

### Phase 3 (Completion - Week 3)
7. **Axiom 1 (Latency)** - Examples to complement exercises
8. **Axiom 7 (Human Interface)** - Operational excellence

## Action Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Complete Axiom 2 examples & exercises
- [ ] Complete Axiom 3 examples & exercises
- [ ] Complete Axiom 4 examples & exercises

### Week 2: Advanced Concepts
- [ ] Complete Axiom 5 examples & exercises
- [ ] Complete Axiom 6 examples & exercises
- [ ] Complete Axiom 8 examples & exercises

### Week 3: Polish
- [ ] Complete Axiom 1 examples
- [ ] Complete Axiom 7 examples & exercises
- [ ] Cross-reference all files
- [ ] Add progression paths

## Content Sources

### For Examples:
- Production postmortems
- Open source implementations
- Conference talks
- Academic papers

### For Exercises:
- Distributed systems courses (MIT, Stanford)
- Industry training materials
- Chaos engineering scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

## Success Metrics

1. **Completeness**: All 16 files > 300 lines
2. **Quality**: Working code examples tested
3. **Practicality**: Real-world applicable
4. **Progression**: Clear difficulty levels
5. **Engagement**: Interactive challenges

## Next Steps

1. Start with Axiom 2 (Capacity) examples
2. Use axiom1-latency/exercises.md as quality template
3. Include production stories for engagement
4. Test all code examples
5. Add visual diagrams where helpful
