# YAML Review: control/index.md

## Critical Error Found: Malformed YAML Frontmatter

**File**: `docs/part2-pillars/control/index.md`
**Priority**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue
Complete YAML frontmatter corruption (identical pattern to truth and intelligence):
- Missing closing quote for description field
- Description field contains HTML tags (`</div>`)
- YAML frontmatter incomplete/broken
- Would break MkDocs build

### Fix Applied
Replaced broken frontmatter with proper YAML structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Pillar 4: Distribution of Control"
description: "How to manage automated systems while maintaining human oversight, emergency controls, and meaningful alerting"
type: pillar
difficulty: intermediate
reading_time: 45 min
prerequisites: ["axiom3-failure", "axiom6-observability", "axiom7-human"]
status: complete
last_updated: 2025-07-20
---
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Build-breaking YAML syntax error
- **After**: Valid YAML frontmatter that follows site standards
- **Result**: File can be processed by MkDocs successfully

### Additional Notes
- Fixed description to properly explain distributed control systems
- Set appropriate prerequisites referencing failure handling, observability, and human factors
- Maintained consistency with other pillar files
- This completes the critical YAML fixes for all part2-pillars files
