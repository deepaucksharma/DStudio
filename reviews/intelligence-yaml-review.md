# YAML Review: intelligence/index.md

## Critical Error Found: Malformed YAML Frontmatter

**File**: `docs/part2-pillars/intelligence/index.md`
**Priority**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed

### Issue
Complete YAML frontmatter corruption (identical pattern to truth/index.md):
- Missing closing quote for description field
- Description field contains HTML tags (`</div>`)
- YAML frontmatter incomplete/broken
- Would break MkDocs build

### Fix Applied
Replaced broken frontmatter with proper YAML structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Pillar 5: Distribution of Intelligence"
description: "How to implement learning and adaptive systems across distributed architectures with machine learning and AI"
type: pillar
difficulty: advanced
reading_time: 50 min
prerequisites: ["axiom6-observability", "axiom7-human", "axiom8-economics"]
status: complete
last_updated: 2025-07-20
---
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Build-breaking YAML syntax error
- **After**: Valid YAML frontmatter that follows site standards
- **Result**: File can be processed by MkDocs successfully

### Additional Notes
- Fixed description to properly explain distributed intelligence/ML
- Set difficulty to "advanced" (more complex than other pillars)
- Added appropriate prerequisites referencing observability, human factors, and economics
- Maintained consistency with other pillar files
