## Project Structure

### Core Documentation
```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ core-principles/      # 7 Laws + 5 Pillars
â”œâ”€â”€ pattern-library/      # 110 patterns organized by category
â”œâ”€â”€ architects-handbook/  # Case studies, tools, implementation guides
â”œâ”€â”€ interview-prep/       # Comprehensive interview preparation
â”œâ”€â”€ excellence/          # Excellence framework and guides
â”œâ”€â”€ reference/           # Glossary, cheatsheets, dashboards
â””â”€â”€ patterns/            # Symlink to pattern-library
```

### Supporting Files
```
scripts/                 # Validation and utility scripts
reports/                 # Project reports (minimal, consolidated)
podcast-content/         # Podcast series content
project-docs/           # Internal documentation
```

## Validation Pipeline

### GitHub Actions
- `comprehensive-validation.yml` - All validation in one workflow
- `deploy.yml` - Deployment with validation dependency

### Core Scripts
- `mkdocs-validator.py` - Primary validation using MkDocs --strict
- `deep-structure-analyzer.py` - Deep structural analysis
- `validate-frontmatter.py` - Frontmatter consistency
- `validate-law-references.py` - Law naming validation
- `validate-paths.py` - Path consistency
- `check-broken-links.py` - Detailed link analysis

## Known Issues

### Minor
1. **Mermaid2 Plugin**: Compatibility warning (doesn't affect functionality)
2. **Anchor Links**: Some internal page anchors need verification
3. **Orphaned Files**: 300+ files intentionally not in main navigation

### Non-Issues
- Orphaned files are documented and intentional (hub-and-spoke model)
- Large deletion count in git history is from removing generated reports

## Next Steps

1. **Content Enhancement**: Continue improving content quality
2. **Interactive Tools**: Add more calculators and simulators
3. **Security Pillar**: Consider adding 6th pillar for security
4. **Pattern Combinations**: Document how patterns work together

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Local development
mkdocs serve

# Run validation
python3 scripts/mkdocs-validator.py

# Build site
mkdocs build --strict

# Deploy (from main branch only)
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
