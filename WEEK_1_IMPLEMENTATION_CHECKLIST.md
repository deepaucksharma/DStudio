- [ ] Create pull request for review

## End of Week 1 Deliverables

### Completed Classifications
- [ ] ~95 patterns classified into Gold/Silver/Bronze
- [ ] All patterns have updated front matter
- [ ] Excellence banners added to all patterns
- [ ] Comparison matrices created for major categories

### Restored Patterns
- [ ] timeout.md (Gold)
- [ ] health-check.md (Gold)
- [ ] crdt.md (Gold)
- [ ] hlc.md (Gold)
- [ ] merkle-trees.md (Gold)

### Documentation
- [ ] Pattern Classification Tracker (spreadsheet)
- [ ] ADR-001: Excellence Classification Criteria
- [ ] ADR-002: Pattern Restoration Decisions
- [ ] Week 1 Summary Report

### Navigation Updates
- [ ] Pattern index updated with tier badges
- [ ] Archive README updated
- [ ] Cross-references verified

## Success Metrics for Week 1

- ✅ 100% of patterns classified
- ✅ 100% of Bronze patterns have modern alternatives documented
- ✅ 100% of Gold patterns have at least 2 company examples
- ✅ 6 incorrectly archived patterns restored
- ✅ 3+ comparison matrices created
- ✅ Zero broken links in pattern pages

## Notes & Blockers

**Potential Issues:**
1. Some patterns may be difficult to classify (edge cases)
2. Finding verified company examples for all Gold patterns
3. Time to update all front matter manually
4. Restore vs. keep archived decisions

**Mitigation:**
1. Create "unclear" category for team discussion
2. Use conference talks and blog posts as sources
3. Automate front matter updates with script
4. Document all restoration decisions in ADR

## Next Week Preview (Week 2)

- Days 8-9: Pattern Evolution Mapping
- Days 10-11: Navigation System Enhancement  
- Days 12-14: Banner Implementation & Testing
