## Patterns with Multiple Category Fit

### Primary: Communication, Secondary: Coordination
- **Distributed Queue** - Message passing is communication, but queue coordination is key
- **Event Sourcing** - Events are communication, but ordering requires coordination
- **Service Mesh** - Communication infrastructure with coordination aspects

### Primary: Data Management, Secondary: Coordination
- **Distributed Storage** - Storage pattern with coordination requirements
- **Consistent Hashing** - Used for data distribution but also load distribution

### Primary: Scaling, Secondary: Data Management
- **Sharding** - Scaling through data partitioning
- **Geo-Replication** - Scaling across regions with data consistency

### Primary: Architecture, Secondary: Multiple
- **Service Discovery/Registry** - Architectural pattern for communication
- **Observability** - Cross-cutting architectural concern
- **Caching Strategies** - Can be scaling or data management

## Patterns to Definitely Merge

### High Priority Merges
1. **Circuit Breaker Consolidation**
   - Keep `circuit-breaker.md` (gold) as main
   - Merge content from `circuit-breaker-native.md` (silver)
   - Create sections for language/platform-specific implementations

2. **Timeout Unification**
   - Base pattern: `timeout.md` (gold)
   - Advanced section from `timeout-advanced.md` (silver)
   - Include production techniques and anti-patterns

3. **Geographic Distribution Suite**
   - Main pattern: `geo-replication.md` (gold)
   - Merge `geo-distribution.md` and `multi-region.md`
   - Create comprehensive guide with deployment strategies

4. **Service Discovery Combination**
   - Merge `service-discovery.md` and `service-registry.md`
   - Both are silver tier, complementary concepts
   - Single pattern covering discovery and registration

### Consider Merging (Need Review)
1. **Event Pattern Suite**
   - Keep separate but cross-reference heavily
   - `event-sourcing.md` - State management focus
   - `event-streaming.md` - Real-time processing focus
   - `event-driven.md` - Architecture style focus

2. **Queue Patterns**
   - `distributed-queue.md` - General purpose queuing
   - `queues-streaming.md` - Stream processing focus
   - May be distinct enough to keep separate

3. **Database Anti-patterns**
   - Merge `shared-database.md` and `singleton-database.md`
   - Both bronze/legacy patterns
   - Present together as anti-patterns

## Special Handling Required

### Cross-Cutting Patterns
These patterns appear in multiple sections or serve multiple purposes:
- **Observability** - Appears in Architecture and Operations sections
- **Service Discovery** - Listed in both Communication and Operations
- **Consistent Hashing** - Used in both Scaling and Data sections

### Educational Patterns
These are more educational than practical:
- **CAP Theorem** (bronze) - Theory/educational
- **Lambda/Kappa Architecture** (bronze) - Historical significance

### Deprecated but Important
Keep for historical context and migration guidance:
- **Stored Procedures** - Show why to avoid
- **Thick Client** - Historical pattern
- **Actor Model** - Niche use cases

## Navigation Structure Recommendations

Each category should have:
1. Overview of category purpose
2. Quick decision matrix
3. Pattern relationship diagram
4. Common combinations

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Structure Creation
1. Create pattern-library directory structure
2. Set up category index pages
3. Create navigation configuration

### Phase 2: Pattern Migration
1. Start with Gold tier patterns
2. Handle merges and consolidations
3. Update all cross-references

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. Add category-specific guides
2. Create pattern combination examples
3. Build interactive selection tools

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Check all internal links
2. Verify pattern metadata
3. Test navigation flow
