```

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. Add "Reference & Standards" section to navigation
2. Add "Analysis & Models" section
3. Link enhanced pattern implementations

### Short-term (Priority 2)
1. Consolidate migration patterns
2. Add interview prep extensions
3. Remove duplicate redirect pages

### Long-term (Priority 3)
1. Reorganize pattern library with progressive disclosure
2. Create comprehensive index pages
3. Implement automated orphan detection

## Impact
