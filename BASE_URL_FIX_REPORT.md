# Base URL Fix Report

## Summary

Successfully converted 193 absolute URL paths to relative paths across 62 markdown files. This fix ensures that links will work correctly when the site is deployed to GitHub Pages at `https://deepaucksharma.github.io/DStudio/`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Link Format Conversion
- **Before**: `[text](/patterns/pattern-matrix)` (absolute)
- **After**: `[text](patterns/pattern-matrix)` (relative)

### 2. Files Modified (62 total)
- Homepage and main navigation
- All axiom/law pages 
- Learning paths
- Google interviews section
- Various pattern and case study pages
- Tool documentation

### 3. Impact
The conversion from absolute to relative paths revealed that many more links are actually broken (2251 total). This is because:
- Absolute paths were incorrectly resolving in some contexts
- Many referenced files don't actually exist
- The true extent of broken links was previously hidden

## Key Fixes by Section

### Navigation & Homepage
- Fixed main navigation links in `index.md`
- Updated pattern selector and learning path links
- Corrected "Get Started" buttons

### Axioms/Laws Section
- Fixed all inter-law navigation (Law 1 â†’ Law 2, etc.)
- Updated references to patterns from law pages
- Corrected breadcrumb navigation

### Google Interviews
- Fixed dashboard navigation links
- Updated pattern library references
- Corrected study guide links

### Learning Paths
- Fixed all cross-references between paths
- Updated links to specific law and pattern pages

## Next Steps

Now that links are properly relative, the remaining 2251 broken links need to be addressed by:
1. Creating missing files (Phase 2)
2. Fixing incorrect paths
3. Removing dead links

## Technical Details

The fix was implemented using a Python script that:
1. Identified all links starting with `/` (absolute paths)
2. Converted them to relative paths by removing the leading `/`
3. Preserved anchor links and external URLs
4. Maintained proper markdown formatting

This ensures the documentation will work correctly both locally and when deployed to GitHub Pages with the `/DStudio` base path.
