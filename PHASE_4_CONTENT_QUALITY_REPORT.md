### 2. Standardized Code Block Formatting ✅

**Findings**:
- Most code blocks already properly formatted
- Correct language tags in use: `python`, `java`, `go`, `yaml`, `bash`, `sql`, `mermaid`, `text`
- No major issues requiring fixes
- Good practices already followed throughout codebase

### 3. Fixed Mathematical Notation ✅

**Files Updated**:
- `/docs/quantitative/cap-theorem.md`
  - Fixed availability probability formula
  - Updated consistency guarantee notation
  - Converted inline formulas to LaTeX

- `/docs/quantitative/littles-law.md`
  - Changed main formula to LaTeX: $L = \lambda \times W$
  - Updated all variable references to math mode
  - Fixed pipeline and queue formulas

- `/docs/quantitative/amdahl-gustafson.md`
  - Converted laws to proper fraction notation
  - Fixed speedup approximation formulas

- `/docs/quantitative/queueing-models.md`
  - Fixed utilization, queue length, and wait time formulas
  - Updated complex Erlang C formula
  - Converted all inline variables to math mode

- `/docs/quantitative/consistency-models.md`
  - Fixed formal definitions with mathematical symbols
  - Updated PBS formula and vector clock notation
  - Fixed complexity notation in tables

### 4. Added SVG Accessibility ✅

**Accessibility Features Added**:
- `role="img"` for screen reader recognition
- `aria-label` with descriptive text
- `<title>` elements for tooltips
- `<desc>` elements for detailed descriptions

**Files Updated**:
- `/docs/quantitative/amdahl-gustafson.md` - 5 SVG elements
- `/docs/quantitative/cache-economics.md` - 2 SVG elements
- `/docs/quantitative/capacity-planning.md` - 6 SVG elements
- `/docs/quantitative/latency-ladder.md` - 4 SVG elements

**Total**: 17 SVG visualizations now fully accessible

## Impact Summary

### Before:
- ❌ 3 files with truncated/incomplete content
- ❌ Inconsistent mathematical notation
- ❌ SVG charts inaccessible to screen readers
- ❌ Mixed formula presentation styles

### After:
- ✅ All content files complete with proper conclusions
- ✅ Consistent LaTeX/MathJax notation throughout
- ✅ 17 SVG elements with full accessibility
- ✅ Professional mathematical presentation

## Quality Metrics

- **Content Completeness**: 100% of identified truncated files completed
- **Code Block Quality**: Already at high standard (no fixes needed)
- **Mathematical Consistency**: 5 files standardized with proper notation
- **Accessibility Coverage**: 17 SVG elements enhanced
- **Files Modified**: 11 files improved

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: UX Enhancements (Ready to implement)
1. Add visual progress indicators for long content
2. Implement consistent calculator styling
3. Enhance mobile responsiveness
4. Add clear learning paths between related concepts

### Additional Improvements
1. Review remaining sections for similar issues
2. Add more interactive elements to quantitative tools
3. Enhance cross-references between related topics
4. Consider adding more visual aids for complex concepts

The documentation now provides complete, accessible, and professionally formatted content with consistent mathematical notation and proper conclusions for all sections.
