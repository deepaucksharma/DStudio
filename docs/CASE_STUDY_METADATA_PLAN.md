# Case Study Excellence Metadata Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the strategy for adding comprehensive excellence metadata to all 91 case studies in the DStudio compendium. The metadata will enable:
- Interactive filtering by scale, domain, and excellence tier
- Pattern usage tracking across real implementations
- Learning path recommendations based on complexity
- Company-specific implementation insights
