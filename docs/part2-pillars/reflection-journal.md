## üí° Knowledge Application

### Exercise 1: Concept Exploration ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Time**: ~15 minutes
**Objective**: Deepen understanding of Micro-Reflection Journal

**Reflection Questions**:
1. What are the 3 most important concepts from this content?
2. How do these concepts relate to systems you work with?
3. What examples from your experience illustrate these ideas?
4. What questions do you still have?

**Application**: Choose one concept and explain it to someone else in your own words.

### Exercise 2: Real-World Connection ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Time**: ~20 minutes
**Objective**: Connect theory to practice

**Research Task**:
1. Find 2 real-world examples where these concepts apply
2. Analyze how the concepts manifest in each example
3. Identify what would happen if these principles were ignored

**Examples could be**:
- Open source projects
- Well-known tech companies
- Systems you use daily
- Historical technology decisions

### Exercise 3: Critical Thinking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Time**: ~25 minutes
**Objective**: Develop deeper analytical skills

**Challenge Scenarios**:
1. **Constraint Analysis**: What limitations or constraints affect applying these concepts?
2. **Trade-off Evaluation**: What trade-offs are involved in following these principles?
3. **Context Dependency**: In what situations might these concepts not apply?
4. **Evolution Prediction**: How might these concepts change as technology evolves?

**Deliverable**: A brief analysis addressing each scenario with specific examples.
