# Pillar 2: State

## The Central Question

How do you keep data consistent across multiple machines when some machines fail and networks partition?

This is the hardest pillar. It's where theoretical computer science meets brutal physical reality.

## The State Trilemma

You can pick two:

```
Consistency: All nodes see the same data
Availability: System remains operational  
Partition Tolerance: Works despite network splits

This isn't a suggestion—it's a mathematical proof.
```

But here's what the CAP theorem doesn't tell you: **most systems need all three, just at different times.**

## 🎬 State Vignette: The DynamoDB Split-Brain of 2015

```
Setting: Amazon DynamoDB, serving millions of requests/second
Scenario: Network partition splits Virginia region

Timeline:
T+0s:   Cable cut between data centers
T+1s:   Both sides think they're primary
T+5s:   Writers continue on both sides
T+10s:  Users see different data depending on location
T+30s:  Conflict detection triggers
T+60s:  Automatic reconciliation begins
T+300s: Full consistency restored

Casualties: 0.001% of data required manual resolution
Lesson: Even Amazon chooses availability over consistency
Physics win: Eventual consistency + conflict resolution
```

## The Consistency Spectrum

Consistency isn't binary—it's a spectrum:

```
Strong Consistency      |  Eventual Consistency
    ↓                  |        ↓
Linearizable           |  Read Your Writes
Sequential             |  Monotonic Reads  
Causal                |  Monotonic Writes
Session               |  Eventually Consistent
                      |  No Guarantees
```

### Mathematical Definitions

**Linearizability**: There exists a total order of operations such that each read returns the value of the most recent write.

**Eventual Consistency**: For any given data item, if no new updates are made, eventually all replicas will converge to the same value.

**Causal Consistency**: Writes that are causally related are seen in the same order by all processes.

## State Replication Patterns

### 1. Primary-Backup Pattern

**When**: Strong consistency required, can tolerate leader failure downtime

```python
class PrimaryBackup:
    def __init__(self, primary, backups):
        self.primary = primary
        self.backups = backups
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write to primary first
        self.primary.write(key, value)
        
        # Synchronously replicate to all backups
        for backup in self.backups:
            backup.write(key, value)  # If this fails, abort
        
        return "success"
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Always read from primary
        return self.primary.read(key)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Strong consistency
- ✅ Simple reasoning model
- ❌ Single point of failure
- ❌ Write latency = slowest replica

### 2. Multi-Master Pattern

**When**: High availability required, can handle conflicts

```python
class MultiMaster:
    def __init__(self, replicas):
        self.replicas = replicas
        self.vector_clock = VectorClock()
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write locally with vector clock
        self.vector_clock.tick()
        record = {
            'value': value,
            'timestamp': self.vector_clock.copy(),
            'replica_id': self.replica_id
        }
        self.local_store[key] = record
        
        # Asynchronously propagate to others
        self.async_replicate(key, record)
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Read local value immediately
        return self.local_store[key]['value']
    
    def resolve_conflict(self, key, records):
        # Last-writer-wins with vector clock comparison
        return max(records, key=lambda r: r['timestamp'])
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ High availability
- ✅ Fast local writes
- ❌ Conflict resolution complexity
- ❌ Eventual consistency only

### 3. Quorum Pattern

**When**: Balance between consistency and availability

```python
class QuorumSystem:
    def __init__(self, replicas, write_quorum, read_quorum):
        self.replicas = replicas
        self.W = write_quorum  # Writes must succeed on W replicas
        self.R = read_quorum   # Reads from R replicas
        self.N = len(replicas) # Total replicas
        
        # For strong consistency: W + R > N
        assert write_quorum + read_quorum > len(replicas)
    
    async def write(self, key, value):
        # Send write to all replicas
        tasks = [replica.write(key, value) for replica in self.replicas]
        
        # Wait for W successes
        successful = 0
        for task in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
            try:
                await task
                successful += 1
                if successful >= self.W:
                    return "success"
            except Exception:
                continue
        
        raise Exception("Write failed - insufficient replicas")
    
    async def read(self, key):
        # Read from R replicas
        tasks = [replica.read(key) for replica in self.replicas[:self.R]]
        values = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        
        # Return most recent value (version number comparison)
        return max(values, key=lambda v: v.version)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Configurable consistency/availability trade-off
- ✅ Survives minority failures
- ❌ Higher latency (must wait for quorum)
- ❌ More complex failure modes

## The CRDT Revolution

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that automatically resolve conflicts:

### G-Counter (Grow-only Counter)

```python
class GCounter:
    def __init__(self, replica_id):
        self.replica_id = replica_id
        self.counts = defaultdict(int)  # counts[replica] = count
    
    def increment(self):
        self.counts[self.replica_id] += 1
    
    def value(self):
        return sum(self.counts.values())
    
    def merge(self, other):
        # Take maximum count for each replica
        for replica, count in other.counts.items():
            self.counts[replica] = max(self.counts[replica], count)
```

**Why this works**: Increment operations commute—order doesn't matter. Maximum function ensures convergence.

### OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set)

```python
class ORSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.added = {}    # element -> set of unique tags
        self.removed = set()  # set of removed tags
    
    def add(self, element):
        tag = (element, uuid4(), time.now())
        if element not in self.added:
            self.added[element] = set()
        self.added[element].add(tag)
    
    def remove(self, element):
        if element in self.added:
            self.removed.update(self.added[element])
    
    def contains(self, element):
        if element not in self.added:
            return False
        return any(tag not in self.removed for tag in self.added[element])
    
    def merge(self, other):
        # Union of all operations
        for element, tags in other.added.items():
            if element not in self.added:
                self.added[element] = set()
            self.added[element].update(tags)
        self.removed.update(other.removed)
```

**Why this works**: Additions and removals are tracked separately with unique identifiers. An element exists if it has been added but not all its additions have been removed.

## State Synchronization Algorithms

### Vector Clocks

Track causality between events:

```python
class VectorClock:
    def __init__(self, replica_id, num_replicas):
        self.replica_id = replica_id
        self.clock = [0] * num_replicas
    
    def tick(self):
        self.clock[self.replica_id] += 1
    
    def update(self, other_clock):
        for i in range(len(self.clock)):
            if i != self.replica_id:
                self.clock[i] = max(self.clock[i], other_clock[i])
        self.tick()
    
    def happened_before(self, other):
        return (self <= other) and (self != other)
    
    def concurrent(self, other):
        return not (self <= other) and not (other <= self)
    
    def __le__(self, other):
        return all(a <= b for a, b in zip(self.clock, other.clock))
```

### Merkle Trees

Efficiently detect differences between replicas:

```python
class MerkleTree:
    def __init__(self, data_blocks):
        self.leaves = [hash(block) for block in data_blocks]
        self.tree = self._build_tree(self.leaves)
    
    def _build_tree(self, nodes):
        if len(nodes) == 1:
            return nodes[0]
        
        next_level = []
        for i in range(0, len(nodes), 2):
            left = nodes[i]
            right = nodes[i+1] if i+1 < len(nodes) else left
            next_level.append(hash(left + right))
        
        return self._build_tree(next_level)
    
    def root_hash(self):
        return self.tree
    
    def diff_blocks(self, other_tree):
        # Returns list of block indices that differ
        # O(log n) comparison instead of O(n)
        return self._compare_trees(self.tree, other_tree.tree, 0, len(self.leaves))
```

## The State Machine Replication Pattern

This is how distributed databases maintain consistency:

```python
class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}
        self.log = []
    
    def apply_operation(self, operation):
        # All replicas apply same operations in same order
        result = self._execute(operation)
        self.log.append(operation)
        return result
    
    def _execute(self, op):
        if op.type == "SET":
            self.state[op.key] = op.value
        elif op.type == "DELETE":
            del self.state[op.key]
        elif op.type == "INCREMENT":
            self.state[op.key] = self.state.get(op.key, 0) + op.delta
        return self.state.get(op.key)

class ReplicatedStateMachine:
    def __init__(self, replicas):
        self.replicas = replicas
        self.consensus = RaftConsensus(replicas)
    
    def submit_operation(self, operation):
        # 1. Achieve consensus on operation order
        committed_op = self.consensus.propose(operation)
        
        # 2. Apply to all replicas in same order
        results = []
        for replica in self.replicas:
            result = replica.apply_operation(committed_op)
            results.append(result)
        
        # All results should be identical
        assert all(r == results[0] for r in results)
        return results[0]
```

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### 1. Read Replicas

```python
class ReadScaledSystem:
    def __init__(self, primary, read_replicas):
        self.primary = primary
        self.read_replicas = read_replicas
        self.replica_selector = RoundRobinSelector(read_replicas)
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        return self.primary.write(key, value)
    
    def read(self, key, consistency="eventual"):
        if consistency == "strong":
            return self.primary.read(key)
        else:
            replica = self.replica_selector.next()
            return replica.read(key)
```

### 2. Write-Through Caching

```python
class WriteThroughCache:
    def __init__(self, cache, database):
        self.cache = cache
        self.database = database
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write to both cache and database
        self.database.write(key, value)
        self.cache.write(key, value)
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Try cache first
        value = self.cache.read(key)
        if value is not None:
            return value
        
        # Fallback to database
        value = self.database.read(key)
        if value is not None:
            self.cache.write(key, value)  # Populate cache
        return value
```

### 3. Sharding

```python
class ShardedDatabase:
    def __init__(self, shards, hash_function=hash):
        self.shards = shards
        self.hash_function = hash_function
    
    def _get_shard(self, key):
        shard_id = self.hash_function(key) % len(self.shards)
        return self.shards[shard_id]
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        shard = self._get_shard(key)
        return shard.write(key, value)
    
    def read(self, key):
        shard = self._get_shard(key)
        return shard.read(key)
    
    def range_query(self, start_key, end_key):
        # Problem: Range queries require querying all shards
        results = []
        for shard in self.shards:
            shard_results = shard.range_query(start_key, end_key)
            results.extend(shard_results)
        return sorted(results)
```

## Counter-Intuitive Truth 💡

**"The strongest consistency guarantee you can achieve in practice is 'session consistency'—where each user sees a consistent view of their own actions."**

Why? Because even "linearizable" systems have edge cases where operations can appear out of order due to client-side retries, network delays, and clock skew.

## State Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Distributed Transaction Trap
```python
# WRONG: Trying to maintain ACID across services
@transaction
def transfer_money(from_account, to_account, amount):
    account_service.debit(from_account, amount)    # Different service
    ledger_service.record_transaction(...)         # Different service  
    notification_service.send_email(...)           # Different service
    # What if the notification service is down?

# RIGHT: Use eventual consistency + compensation
def transfer_money(from_account, to_account, amount):
    transaction_id = uuid4()
    
    # Start with local transaction
    account_service.debit(from_account, amount, transaction_id)
    
    # Use events for eventual consistency
    event_bus.publish("money_debited", {
        "transaction_id": transaction_id,
        "to_account": to_account,
        "amount": amount
    })
```

### 2. The Read-After-Write Inconsistency
```python
# WRONG: Assuming immediate consistency
user_service.update_profile(user_id, new_name)
profile = user_service.get_profile(user_id)  # Might return old name!

# RIGHT: Return the updated value or use session consistency
new_profile = user_service.update_profile(user_id, new_name)
return new_profile  # Guaranteed to reflect the update
```

### 3. The Hot Shard Problem
```python
# WRONG: Celebrity users break your sharding
shard = hash(user_id) % num_shards  # Taylor Swift overwhelms one shard

# RIGHT: Detect and mitigate hot shards
class AdaptiveSharding:
    def get_shard(self, key):
        if key in self.hot_keys:
            # Distribute hot keys across multiple shards
            sub_shard = hash(key + str(time.now() // 60)) % 10
            return self.hot_key_shards[sub_shard]
        return self.normal_shards[hash(key) % len(self.normal_shards)]
```

## The Future of State Management

Three trends are reshaping distributed state:

1. **Serverless Databases**: Push state management to managed services
2. **CRDT-Native Systems**: Build conflict resolution into the data layer
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable, decentralized state for specific use cases

Each represents a different trade-off in the consistency/availability/partition-tolerance space.
