# Pillar 2: Distribution of State

**Learning Objective**: Master the art of splitting data without splitting reliability.

## The Central Question

How do you spread data across multiple machines while maintaining consistency, durability, and performance?

This is harder than distributing work because state has *memory*â€”past decisions affect future operations.

## First Principles of State Distribution

```
State is fundamentally different from computation:
- Work can be retried; state changes are permanent
- Work is stateless between requests; state persists
- Work can be duplicated; state must be coordinated
- Work scales by adding workers; state scales by partitioning
```

## The State Trilemma

```
            Consistency
                /\
               /  \
              /    \
             /      \
            /________\
    Availability    Partition Tolerance
    
You can only guarantee 2 of 3 (CAP Theorem)
But in practice, P is mandatory in distributed systems
So you're really choosing between C and A
```

## ðŸŽ¬ State Vignette: The GitHub Database Outage

```
Setting: GitHub, October 21, 2018
Problem: 43 seconds of split-brain, 24 hours to recover

Timeline:
21:52:00 - Routine maintenance replaces failing network device
21:52:27 - Network partition: East Coast âŸ· West Coast split
21:52:40 - Each coast thinks the other is down
21:53:00 - Both elect new primary databases
21:53:10 - Two authoritative sources of truth!

During split-brain (43 seconds):
- East Coast: 944 writes
- West Coast: 673 writes  
- Conflicts: 187 users affected

Recovery nightmare:
- Couldn't merge writes (different schemas evolved)
- Had to choose West Coast as authoritative
- 24-hour outage to reconcile
- Some data permanently lost

Lesson: Split-brain is the ultimate state distribution failure
```

## State Distribution Patterns

### 1. Leader-Follower Replication

**When**: Read-heavy workloads with consistency needs

```python
class LeaderFollowerDB:
    def write(self, key, value):
        # All writes go to leader
        leader.write(key, value)
        
        # Replicate to followers
        for follower in followers:
            # Async replication = eventual consistency
            # Sync replication = strong consistency but slower
            async_replicate(follower, key, value)
    
    def read(self, key, consistency='eventual'):
        if consistency == 'strong':
            return leader.read(key)  # May overload leader
        else:
            return random_follower.read(key)  # May be stale
```

**Trade-offs**:
- âœ“ Simple mental model
- âœ“ Read scaling
- âœ— Write bottleneck at leader
- âœ— Failover complexity

### 2. Multi-Leader Replication

**When**: Multi-region deployments with local writes

```python
class MultiLeaderDB:
    def write(self, key, value, region):
        # Write locally first
        local_leader[region].write(key, value, timestamp)
        
        # Async replicate to other regions
        for other_region in regions:
            if other_region != region:
                replicate_async(other_region, key, value, timestamp)
    
    def handle_conflict(self, key, value1, ts1, value2, ts2):
        # Last-write-wins
        return (value1, ts1) if ts1 > ts2 else (value2, ts2)
        
        # Or merge (CRDTs)
        return merge_values(value1, value2)
        
        # Or manual resolution
        return queue_for_human_review(key, value1, value2)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- âœ“ Low latency writes globally
- âœ“ Regional failure tolerance
- âœ— Complex conflict resolution
- âœ— Eventual consistency only

### 3. Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning)

**When**: Single table too large for one machine

```python
class ShardedDB:
    def __init__(self, num_shards):
        self.shards = [DatabaseShard() for _ in range(num_shards)]
    
    def shard_key(self, key):
        # Consistent hashing for better distribution
        return consistent_hash(key) % len(self.shards)
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        shard_id = self.shard_key(key)
        self.shards[shard_id].write(key, value)
    
    def read(self, key):
        shard_id = self.shard_key(key)
        return self.shards[shard_id].read(key)
    
    def range_query(self, start_key, end_key):
        # Horror: Must query all shards!
        results = []
        for shard in self.shards:
            results.extend(shard.range_query(start_key, end_key))
        return merge_sorted(results)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- âœ“ Linear scaling for point queries
- âœ“ True parallel processing
- âœ— No efficient range queries
- âœ— No cross-shard transactions
- âœ— Resharding is painful

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Framework: State Strategy

```
ANALYZE your access patterns:
â”œâ”€ Read/Write ratio?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ >90% reads â†’ Leader-follower
â”‚  â”œâ”€ 50/50 â†’ Sharding
â”‚  â””â”€ Write-heavy â†’ Consider redesign
â”‚

â”‚  â”œâ”€ Financial/inventory â†’ Strong consistency
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Social media â†’ Eventual consistency OK
â”‚  â””â”€ Analytics â†’ Stale data often fine
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Query patterns?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Point queries â†’ Sharding works
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Range queries â†’ Range partitioning
â”‚  â””â”€ Complex queries â†’ Keep centralized
â”‚

   â”œâ”€ Single region â†’ Simple replication
   â”œâ”€ Multi-region reads â†’ Geo-replicas
   â””â”€ Multi-region writes â†’ Multi-leader or CRDTs
```

## State Consistency Models

From strongest to weakest:

### 1. Linearizability
"As if there's only one copy of the data"
```
Cost: Global coordination on every operation
Use: Configuration data, critical sections
```

### 2. Sequential Consistency
"All nodes see operations in the same order"
```
Cost: Ordering protocol overhead
Use: Financial transactions
```

### 3. Causal Consistency
"Related operations are ordered, unrelated may not be"
```
Cost: Vector clocks or similar
Use: Social media comments, chat
```

### 4. Eventual Consistency
"If updates stop, all nodes eventually converge"
```
Cost: Conflict resolution complexity
Use: Shopping carts, user preferences
```

## The State Replication Lag Formula

```
Replication Lag = Network Latency + Queue Depth / Throughput + Processing Time

Where:
- Network Latency = Distance / Speed of Light
- Queue Depth = Write Rate Ã— Average Lag
- Processing Time = Log Apply Time + Index Updates

Example (cross-country replication):
- Network: 50ms (SF â†” NYC)
- Queue: 1000 writes Ã— 0.1s = 100ms
- Processing: 10ms
- Total Lag: 160ms typical, 500ms+ under load
```

## ðŸ”§ Try This: Implement Vector Clocks

```python
class VectorClock:
    def __init__(self, node_id, num_nodes):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.clock = [0] * num_nodes
    
    def increment(self):
        """Increment on local event"""
        self.clock[self.node_id] += 1
        return self.clock.copy()
    
    def update(self, other_clock):
        """Update on message receive"""
        for i in range(len(self.clock)):
            self.clock[i] = max(self.clock[i], other_clock[i])
        self.increment()  # Increment local after merge
    
    def happens_before(self, other):
        """Check if self â†’ other"""
        return all(self.clock[i] <= other.clock[i] for i in range(len(self.clock))) \
               and any(self.clock[i] < other.clock[i] for i in range(len(self.clock)))
    
    def concurrent_with(self, other):
        """Check if self || other"""
        return not self.happens_before(other) and not other.happens_before(self)

# Usage example
node_a = VectorClock(0, 3)
node_b = VectorClock(1, 3)

# A performs local operation
ts_a1 = node_a.increment()  # [1,0,0]

# A sends message to B
node_b.update(ts_a1)  # B becomes [1,1,0]

# B performs local operation  
ts_b1 = node_b.increment()  # [1,2,0]

# Check causality
print(ts_a1.happens_before(ts_b1))  # True: A's event happened before B's
```

## State Anti-Patterns

### 1. The "Eventual Consistency Will Save Us" Fallacy
```python
# WRONG: Assuming conflicts are rare
user_balance = eventually_consistent_db.read("user_123")
if user_balance >= purchase_amount:
    eventually_consistent_db.write("user_123", user_balance - purchase_amount)
    # Race condition: Multiple purchases can succeed with insufficient funds!

# RIGHT: Use strong consistency for financial operations
with distributed_lock("user_123"):
    user_balance = strongly_consistent_db.read("user_123")
    if user_balance >= purchase_amount:
        strongly_consistent_db.write("user_123", user_balance - purchase_amount)
```

### 2. The "We'll Shard Later" Trap
```python
# WRONG: Not planning for sharding
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  # Auto-increment doesn't shard!
    email VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()  # Can't query by time across shards
);

# RIGHT: Shard-friendly schema
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,  # Globally unique
    email VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    shard_key VARCHAR(50),  # Explicit shard control
    INDEX idx_shard_time (shard_key, created_at)  # Shard-local time queries
);
```

### 3. The "Cache Invalidation is Easy" Delusion
```python
# WRONG: Forgetting about cache consistency
def update_user(user_id, new_data):
    database.update(user_id, new_data)
    cache.delete(user_id)  # What about other caches?
    # What about derived data?
    # What about in-flight requests?

# RIGHT: Event-driven invalidation
def update_user(user_id, new_data):
    with transaction() as tx:
        database.update(user_id, new_data)
        event_bus.publish("user.updated", {
            "user_id": user_id,
            "version": new_data.version,
            "timestamp": now()
        })
    # Let caches subscribe and invalidate themselves
```

## Counter-Intuitive Truth ðŸ’¡

**"The hardest part of distributed state isn't the distributionâ€”it's handling partial failures during distribution."**

A single-node database fails completely (easy to detect). A distributed database fails partially (some nodes up, some down, some slow), creating states that are nearly impossible to reason about.

## State Monitoring Essentials

```
Key Metrics:
1. Replication lag (seconds behind primary)
2. Conflict rate (conflicts/second)
3. Shard balance (requests/shard deviation)
4. Cache hit rate (% served from cache)
5. Lock contention (lock wait time)

Key Alerts:
- Replication lag > 10 seconds
- Any shard > 2x average load  
- Cache hit rate < 80%
- Conflict rate spike (>5x baseline)
```

*"State is the root of all evil in distributed systems. Eliminate it where possible, isolate it where necessary, replicate it where unavoidable."*

## The CRDT Revolution

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that automatically resolve conflicts:

### G-Counter (Grow-only Counter)

```python
class GCounter:
    def __init__(self, replica_id):
        self.replica_id = replica_id
        self.counts = defaultdict(int)  # counts[replica] = count
    
    def increment(self):
        self.counts[self.replica_id] += 1
    
    def value(self):
        return sum(self.counts.values())
    
    def merge(self, other):
        # Take maximum count for each replica
        for replica, count in other.counts.items():
            self.counts[replica] = max(self.counts[replica], count)
```

**Why this works**: Increment operations commuteâ€”order doesn't matter. Maximum function ensures convergence.

### OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set)

```python
class ORSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.added = {}    # element -> set of unique tags
        self.removed = set()  # set of removed tags
    
    def add(self, element):
        tag = (element, uuid4(), time.now())
        if element not in self.added:
            self.added[element] = set()
        self.added[element].add(tag)
    
    def remove(self, element):
        if element in self.added:
            self.removed.update(self.added[element])
    
    def contains(self, element):
        if element not in self.added:
            return False
        return any(tag not in self.removed for tag in self.added[element])
    
    def merge(self, other):
        # Union of all operations
        for element, tags in other.added.items():
            if element not in self.added:
                self.added[element] = set()
            self.added[element].update(tags)
        self.removed.update(other.removed)
```

**Why this works**: Additions and removals are tracked separately with unique identifiers. An element exists if it has been added but not all its additions have been removed.

```

## State Synchronization Algorithms

### Vector Clocks

Track causality between events:

```python
class VectorClock:
    def __init__(self, replica_id, num_replicas):
        self.replica_id = replica_id
        self.clock = [0] * num_replicas
    
    def tick(self):
        self.clock[self.replica_id] += 1
    
    def update(self, other_clock):
        for i in range(len(self.clock)):
            if i != self.replica_id:
                self.clock[i] = max(self.clock[i], other_clock[i])
        self.tick()
    
    def happened_before(self, other):
        return (self <= other) and (self != other)
    
    def concurrent(self, other):
        return not (self <= other) and not (other <= self)
    
    def __le__(self, other):
        return all(a <= b for a, b in zip(self.clock, other.clock))
```

### Merkle Trees

Efficiently detect differences between replicas:

```python
class MerkleTree:
    def __init__(self, data_blocks):
        self.leaves = [hash(block) for block in data_blocks]
        self.tree = self._build_tree(self.leaves)
    
    def _build_tree(self, nodes):
        if len(nodes) == 1:
            return nodes[0]
        
        next_level = []
        for i in range(0, len(nodes), 2):
            left = nodes[i]
            right = nodes[i+1] if i+1 < len(nodes) else left
            next_level.append(hash(left + right))
        
        return self._build_tree(next_level)
    
    def root_hash(self):
        return self.tree
    
    def diff_blocks(self, other_tree):
        # Returns list of block indices that differ
        # O(log n) comparison instead of O(n)
        return self._compare_trees(self.tree, other_tree.tree, 0, len(self.leaves))
```

## The State Machine Replication Pattern

This is how distributed databases maintain consistency:

```python
class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}
        self.log = []
    
    def apply_operation(self, operation):
        # All replicas apply same operations in same order
        result = self._execute(operation)
        self.log.append(operation)
        return result
    
    def _execute(self, op):
        if op.type == "SET":
            self.state[op.key] = op.value
        elif op.type == "DELETE":
            del self.state[op.key]
        elif op.type == "INCREMENT":
            self.state[op.key] = self.state.get(op.key, 0) + op.delta
        return self.state.get(op.key)

class ReplicatedStateMachine:
    def __init__(self, replicas):
        self.replicas = replicas
        self.consensus = RaftConsensus(replicas)
    
    def submit_operation(self, operation):
        # 1. Achieve consensus on operation order
        committed_op = self.consensus.propose(operation)
        
        # 2. Apply to all replicas in same order
        results = []
        for replica in self.replicas:
            result = replica.apply_operation(committed_op)
            results.append(result)
        
        # All results should be identical
        assert all(r == results[0] for r in results)
        return results[0]
```

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### 1. Read Replicas

```python
class ReadScaledSystem:
    def __init__(self, primary, read_replicas):
        self.primary = primary
        self.read_replicas = read_replicas
        self.replica_selector = RoundRobinSelector(read_replicas)
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        return self.primary.write(key, value)
    
    def read(self, key, consistency="eventual"):
        if consistency == "strong":
            return self.primary.read(key)
        else:
            replica = self.replica_selector.next()
            return replica.read(key)
```

### 2. Write-Through Caching

```python
class WriteThroughCache:
    def __init__(self, cache, database):
        self.cache = cache
        self.database = database
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        # Write to both cache and database
        self.database.write(key, value)
        self.cache.write(key, value)
    
    def read(self, key):
        # Try cache first
        value = self.cache.read(key)
        if value is not None:
            return value
        
        # Fallback to database
        value = self.database.read(key)
        if value is not None:
            self.cache.write(key, value)  # Populate cache
        return value
```

### 3. Sharding

```python
class ShardedDatabase:
    def __init__(self, shards, hash_function=hash):
        self.shards = shards
        self.hash_function = hash_function
    
    def _get_shard(self, key):
        shard_id = self.hash_function(key) % len(self.shards)
        return self.shards[shard_id]
    
    def write(self, key, value):
        shard = self._get_shard(key)
        return shard.write(key, value)
    
    def read(self, key):
        shard = self._get_shard(key)
        return shard.read(key)
    
    def range_query(self, start_key, end_key):
        # Problem: Range queries require querying all shards
        results = []
        for shard in self.shards:
            shard_results = shard.range_query(start_key, end_key)
            results.extend(shard_results)
        return sorted(results)
```

## Counter-Intuitive Truth ðŸ’¡

**"The strongest consistency guarantee you can achieve in practice is 'session consistency'â€”where each user sees a consistent view of their own actions."**

Why? Because even "linearizable" systems have edge cases where operations can appear out of order due to client-side retries, network delays, and clock skew.

## State Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Distributed Transaction Trap
```python
# WRONG: Trying to maintain ACID across services
@transaction
def transfer_money(from_account, to_account, amount):
    account_service.debit(from_account, amount)    # Different service
    ledger_service.record_transaction(...)         # Different service  
    notification_service.send_email(...)           # Different service
    # What if the notification service is down?

# RIGHT: Use eventual consistency + compensation
def transfer_money(from_account, to_account, amount):
    transaction_id = uuid4()
    
    # Start with local transaction
    account_service.debit(from_account, amount, transaction_id)
    
    # Use events for eventual consistency
    event_bus.publish("money_debited", {
        "transaction_id": transaction_id,
        "to_account": to_account,
        "amount": amount
    })
```

### 2. The Read-After-Write Inconsistency
```python
# WRONG: Assuming immediate consistency
user_service.update_profile(user_id, new_name)
profile = user_service.get_profile(user_id)  # Might return old name!

# RIGHT: Return the updated value or use session consistency
new_profile = user_service.update_profile(user_id, new_name)
return new_profile  # Guaranteed to reflect the update
```

### 3. The Hot Shard Problem
```python
# WRONG: Celebrity users break your sharding
shard = hash(user_id) % num_shards  # Taylor Swift overwhelms one shard

# RIGHT: Detect and mitigate hot shards
class AdaptiveSharding:
    def get_shard(self, key):
        if key in self.hot_keys:
            # Distribute hot keys across multiple shards
            sub_shard = hash(key + str(time.now() // 60)) % 10
            return self.hot_key_shards[sub_shard]
        return self.normal_shards[hash(key) % len(self.normal_shards)]
```

## The Future of State Management

Three trends are reshaping distributed state:

1. **Serverless Databases**: Push state management to managed services
2. **CRDT-Native Systems**: Build conflict resolution into the data layer
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable, decentralized state for specific use cases
