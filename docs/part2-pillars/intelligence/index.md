## Level 1: Intuition (Start Here) 🌱

### The Thermostat Evolution Metaphor

Think about temperature control evolution:
- **Manual**: You adjust heat when cold
- **Basic Thermostat**: Maintains set temperature
- **Smart Thermostat**: Learns your schedule
- **Intelligent Home**: Predicts needs, saves energy
- **Adaptive System**: Optimizes comfort vs cost

**This is distributed intelligence**: Systems that learn from experience and improve autonomously.

### Real-World Analogy: Restaurant Kitchen Intelligence

```yaml
Evolution of a Restaurant Kitchen:

Week 1: Manual Everything
- Chef tastes every dish
- Writes down popular items
- Adjusts portions by memory

Month 1: Basic Patterns
- Track bestsellers
- Standard portion sizes
- Rush hour prep lists

Year 1: Smart Operations
- Predict busy nights
- Dynamic menu pricing
- Inventory optimization
- Staff scheduling AI

Intelligence emerges from:
- Data (orders, feedback)
- Patterns (busy times)
- Adaptation (menu changes)
- Feedback loops (reviews)
```

### Core Principle: Intelligence Emerges from Feedback

### The Intelligence Spectrum

### The Learning Hierarchy

```dockerfile
Supervised Learning 📚
├─ Learn from labeled examples
├─ "This email is spam"
├─ Predict labels for new data
└─ Use case: Classification

Unsupervised Learning 🔍
├─ Find patterns without labels
├─ "These users are similar"
├─ Discover hidden structure
└─ Use case: Clustering

Reinforcement Learning 🎮
├─ Learn from rewards/penalties
├─ "That action increased revenue"
├─ Optimize future actions
└─ Use case: Decision making

Transfer Learning 🔄
├─ Apply knowledge across domains
├─ "Image recognition → Medical imaging"
├─ Leverage existing models
└─ Use case: Limited data scenarios
