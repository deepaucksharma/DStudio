## From Principles to Practice

      theory and practice. In practice, there is."

## What's Next

In Part III, we'll explore 20 battle-tested patterns that emerge from the axioms and pillars. Each pattern is:

- **Derived**: Not arbitrary, but logical consequences of constraints
- **Proven**: Used in production at scale
- **Practical**: With code you can adapt
- **Honest**: We'll tell you where each pattern breaks

Remember: Patterns are tools, not rules. The best architects know when to break them.

## Part III Preview: Modern Architectural Patterns

Having established the fundamental constraints (Axioms) and organizing principles (Pillars), Part III presents the patterns that naturally emerge when building real systems under these constraints.

Each pattern will be presented with:
1. **The physics** that makes it necessary
2. **The implementation** that makes it work
3. **The trade-offs** that make it honest
4. **The war stories** that make it real

Let the pattern journey begin...
