## Level 1: Intuition (Start Here) 🌱

### The Cruise Control Metaphor

Think about driving a car:
- **Manual Control**: You control speed with gas pedal
- **Cruise Control**: Set speed, car maintains it
- **Adaptive Cruise**: Adjusts to traffic automatically
- **Emergency Override**: Brake instantly takes control back
- **Driver Still Essential**: For decisions and emergencies

**This is distributed control**: Automation handles routine, humans handle exceptions.

### Real-World Analogy: Restaurant Kitchen

```yaml
Busy Restaurant Kitchen Control:

Head Chef: "Fire table 12!"
Grill Cook: Starts steaks automatically
Sauce Chef: Begins reduction on cue
Expediter: Coordinates timing

What's the control system?
- Standard procedures (recipes)
- Real-time coordination (expediter)
- Quality checks (head chef)
- Emergency overrides (stop everything!)

When rush hits:
- Procedures scale the operation
- Humans handle exceptions
- Clear escalation paths
- Everyone knows their role
```

This concept map illustrates how control distribution balances human oversight with automation, deployment strategies, and observability. The "Ironies of Automation" remind us that more automation often requires more sophisticated human control.
