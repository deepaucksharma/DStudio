## Level 1: Intuition (Start Here) 🌱

### The Library Card Catalog Metaphor

Imagine a library before computers:
- **Single Catalog**: One card drawer = one source of truth
- **Multiple Libraries**: How do they stay in sync?
- **Book Borrowed**: Update your catalog... but what about others?
- **Phone Lines Down**: Can't call other libraries
- **Librarian Sick**: Who updates the cards?

**This is distributed truth**: Multiple copies, no master, must agree somehow.

### Real-World Analogy: Group Chat Planning

```yaml
Friend Group Planning Dinner:

Alice: "Let's meet at 7pm at Pizza Place"
Bob: "I thought we said 8pm?"
Carol: "Wait, I have 7:30pm at Burger Joint"
Dave: [Phone died, missed everything]

What's the truth?
- No single authority
- Messages arrive out of order
- Some people offline
- Must reach agreement somehow

Solution: Consensus!
"Everyone reply with thumbs up to: 7:30pm Pizza Place"
✅ ✅ ✅ [Dave still offline]
3/4 majority = That's our truth
```

         🤝 Consensus Truth

                    |
                    |
         📝 Eventual Truth
              (Will agree... someday)
                    |
                    |

## Level 2: Foundation (Understand Why) 🌿

### Core Principle: Truth is Agreement

### The CAP Theorem Refresher

### The Hierarchy of Distributed Truth

```yaml
Level 5: Global Total Order 💰💰💰💰💰
   └─ Most expensive (blockchain, atomic broadcast)
   └─ Every event has exact position
   └─ Use case: Financial ledgers

Level 4: Causal Order 💰💰💰💰
   └─ Preserves cause-and-effect (vector clocks)
   └─ If A caused B, A comes before B everywhere
   └─ Use case: Social media comments

Level 3: Consensus Truth 💰💰💰
   └─ Majority agreement (Raft, Paxos)
   └─ Majority decides the truth
   └─ Use case: Configuration management

Level 2: Eventual Truth 💰💰
   └─ Converges over time (CRDTs, gossip)
   └─ Truth emerges eventually
   └─ Use case: Shopping carts

Level 1: Local Truth 💰
   └─ What I believe right now
   └─ No coordination needed
   └─ Use case: Caching

Cost increases exponentially with each level

This concept map shows how distributed truth branches into consensus mechanisms, time ordering, conflict resolution, and trust models. Each is constrained by fundamental theorems and axioms.
