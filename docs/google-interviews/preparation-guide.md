    Problem[Problem Statement]
    
    Problem --> Scale{Think Scale}
    Scale --> Billions[Billions of Users]
    Scale --> Exabytes[Exabytes of Data]
    Scale --> Millions[Millions QPS]
    
    Billions --> Simple[Keep It Simple]
    Exabytes --> Efficient[Be Efficient]
    Millions --> Reliable[Build Reliable]
    
    Simple --> Solution[Elegant Solution]

    Reliable --> Solution
```

### Decision Framework
1. **Can it scale 10x?** - Every component
2. **What fails first?** - Identify bottlenecks
3. **How much does it cost?** - At scale
4. **Is it simple?** - Complexity kills
5. **How do we monitor?** - Observability first
