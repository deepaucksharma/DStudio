## Pre-Interview Preparation

### The Week Before

```python
class WeekBeforePrep:
    def daily_schedule(self):
        return {
            "Day_7": "Review core distributed systems concepts",
            "Day_6": "Practice 2 full system designs",
            "Day_5": "Deep dive Google technologies",
            "Day_4": "Work on communication clarity",

            "Day_1": "Light review, rest well"
        }
    
    def key_areas(self):
        return [
            "CAP theorem and consistency models",
            "Scaling patterns (sharding, replication)",
            "Google systems (GFS, Bigtable, Spanner)",
            "Estimation and capacity planning",
            "Trade-off analysis"
        ]
```

### The Night Before

✅ **DO:**
- Review your notes briefly (30 mins max)
- Prepare your setup (computer, internet, quiet space)
- Get 8 hours of sleep
- Set multiple alarms
- Prepare water and snacks

❌ **DON'T:**
- Cram new concepts
- Stay up late practicing
- Consume excessive caffeine
- Read interview horror stories
- Second-guess your preparation

## Interview Day Strategy

### The First 5 Minutes

```python
def interview_opening():
    """
    Make a strong first impression
    """
    steps = [
        "Greet warmly and professionally",
        "Test audio/video if remote",
        "Have paper and pen ready",
        "Listen carefully to the problem",
        "Take notes while listening"
    ]
    
# What interviewers notice
    positive_signals = [
        "Confident but humble demeanor",
        "Active listening",
        "Thoughtful questions",
        "Structured approach",
        "Clear communication"
    ]
    
    return steps, positive_signals
```

### The Clarification Phase

```mermaid
graph LR
    P[Problem Statement] --> C{Clarify}
    C --> U[Users]
    C --> S[Scale]
    C --> F[Features]
    C --> N[Non-functional]
    
    U --> D[Design]
    S --> D
    F --> D
    N --> D
```

**Smart Questions to Ask:**

```python
class ClarificationQuestions:
    def essential_questions(self):
        return {
            "Scale": [
                "How many users are we designing for?",
                "What's the expected QPS?",
                "How much data will we store?"
            ],
            "Features": [
                "What's the MVP vs full feature set?",
                "Are there any specific features to prioritize?",
                "What features are explicitly out of scope?"
            ],
            "Constraints": [
                "Any specific latency requirements?",
                "Budget constraints?",
                "Team size constraints?"
            ],
            "Success": [
                "How do we measure success?",
                "What are the key metrics?",
                "What's the business goal?"
            ]
        }
```

## Design Phase Excellence

### The Structured Approach

```
1. Requirements Summary (2 min)
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Out of scope

2. Capacity Estimation (3 min)
   - Users and growth
   - Storage needs
   - Bandwidth requirements

3. High-Level Design (10 min)
   - Major components
   - Data flow
   - API design

4. Detailed Design (15 min)
   - Data models
   - Algorithm choices
   - Component details

5. Scale & Optimize (10 min)
   - Bottleneck analysis
   - Caching strategy
   - Sharding approach

6. Reliability & Monitoring (5 min)
   - Failure scenarios
   - Monitoring strategy
   - Deployment approach
```

### Drawing Effective Diagrams

```python
class DiagramTips:
    def best_practices(self):
        return [
            "Start with boxes for major components",
            "Use arrows to show data flow",
            "Label everything clearly",
            "Use different colors for different types",
            "Keep it clean and organized",
            "Build incrementally"
        ]
    
    def component_symbols(self):
        return {
            "□": "Service/Server",
            "⬭": "Database",
            "○": "Cache",
            "⬟": "Queue",
            "△": "Load Balancer",
            "◇": "Client"
        }
```

## Communication Excellence

### The PREP Method

```
P - Point: State your main point
R - Reason: Explain why
E - Example: Give concrete example
P - Point: Restate conclusion

Example:
P: "I'd use consistent hashing for sharding"
R: "Because it minimizes data movement when scaling"
E: "Like DynamoDB, adding a node only moves 1/n data"
P: "So consistent hashing gives us elastic scaling"
```

### Thinking Aloud Effectively

```python
def think_aloud_examples():
    good_examples = [
        "I'm considering two approaches here...",
        "Let me think about the trade-offs...",
        "I'm calculating the storage needs...",
        "I'm wondering if we need strong consistency here..."
    ]
    
    avoid_these = [
        "Umm... I don't know...",
        "This is probably wrong but...",
        "I'm not sure if this makes sense...",
        "Sorry, I'm rambling..."
    ]
    
    return good_examples, avoid_these
```

## Handling Difficult Moments

### When You're Stuck

```python
class StuckStrategies:
    def recovery_tactics(self):
        return [
            {
                "tactic": "Break it down",
                "example": "Let me approach this step by step..."
            },
            {
                "tactic": "Think analogies",
                "example": "This reminds me of how X works..."
            },
            {
                "tactic": "Ask for hints",
                "example": "Am I thinking in the right direction?"
            },
            {
                "tactic": "State assumptions",
                "example": "I'll assume X for now and revisit..."
            }
        ]
```

### When Challenged

```mermaid
graph TD
    C[Challenged] --> L{Listen Fully}
    L --> U[Understand Concern]
    U --> A{Agree?}
    
    A -->|Yes| Y[Acknowledge & Adjust]
    A -->|Partially| P[Find Common Ground]
    A -->|No| N[Explain Reasoning]
    
    Y --> M[Move Forward]
    P --> M
    N --> M
```

**Response Templates:**

```python
def challenge_responses():
    return {
        "Valid point": "That's a great point. Let me revise my approach...",
        "Different view": "I see your perspective. Another way to think about it...",
        "Clarification": "Let me make sure I understand your concern...",
        "Trade-off": "You're right about X, but we gain Y which is important because..."
    }
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Technical Mistakes

```python
class TechnicalMistakes:
    common_errors = {
        "Single_point_of_failure": "Always identify and address SPOF",
        "Ignoring_data_consistency": "Be explicit about consistency model",
        "Over_engineering": "Don't use Spanner for 100GB",
        "Under_engineering": "Don't use SQLite for Google scale",
        "Missing_monitoring": "Always discuss observability",
        "Ignoring_security": "At least mention authentication/authorization"
    }
    
    def avoid_mistakes(self, design):
        checklist = [
            "No single points of failure?",
            "Consistency model defined?",
            "Appropriate for scale?",
            "Monitoring included?",
            "Security considered?",
            "Trade-offs acknowledged?"
        ]
        return all(self.check(item) for item in checklist)
```

### Communication Mistakes

❌ **Avoid These:**
- Jumping to implementation without design
- Being defensive about feedback
- Saying "I don't know" without trying
- Over-apologizing
- Being arrogant or dismissive
- Ignoring the interviewer

✅ **Do These Instead:**
- Start with high-level design
- Be collaborative and open
- Think through problems aloud
- Be confident but humble
- Engage with the interviewer
- Show enthusiasm

## The Final 10 Minutes
