# Social Graph Architecture

> ðŸš§ This case study is planned for future development.

## Overview
This case study would cover the design and implementation of distributed social graph systems, focusing on:
- Friend recommendation algorithms
- Graph traversal at scale
- Community detection
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Privacy and access control in social networks

## Key Challenges
- Managing billions of vertices and edges
- Real-time friend suggestions
- Handling highly connected nodes (celebrities)
- Privacy-aware graph queries
- Distributed graph storage and processing
