## Failure Scenarios & Lessons

!!! danger "Major Incident: New Year's Eve 2016 Location Overload"
 **What Happened**: Massive surge in ride requests during New Year's celebrations overwhelmed location tracking systems, causing driver locations to appear stale or incorrect.

 **Root Cause**: 
 - 10x normal traffic spike during peak celebration hours
 - Location update queues backed up due to insufficient capacity
 - Cache invalidation storms from rapid location changes
 - Network congestion in dense urban areas

 **Impact**: 
 - 3 hours of degraded location accuracy
 - 30% increase in wait times due to poor driver matching
 - Customer complaints about "phantom" nearby drivers
 - Revenue loss during peak demand period

 **Lessons Learned**:
 1. **Predictive scaling**: Implement automated scaling based on event calendars and historical patterns
 2. **Queue management**: Add backpressure and priority queuing for location updates
 3. **Graceful degradation**: Fall back to last-known-good locations when real-time fails

### Bronze Pattern Evolution

<div class="migration-box">
<h4>🔄 From Polling to Streaming</h4>

Uber's location system evolution (2009-2015):

1. **2009**: PHP + MySQL with 30-second polling
2. **2011**: Redis cache layer added, 5-second updates
3. **2013**: Kafka streaming introduced
4. **2015**: Full event-driven architecture

**Key Insight**: The polling approach worked until ~1M daily rides, then hit scaling limits.

**Migration Steps**:
- Dual-write to both systems
- Gradual traffic migration by city
- Complete cutover after 6 months
