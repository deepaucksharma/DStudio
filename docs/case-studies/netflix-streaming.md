## Executive Summary

Netflix transformed from a DVD-by-mail service to the world's largest streaming platform through radical architectural decisions. By embracing microservices, chaos engineering, and cloud-native design, Netflix processes over 1 billion hours of content monthly while maintaining sub-second startup times. Their architecture demonstrates how to build systems that scale globally while remaining resilient to constant failures.

## Design Deep Dive

### Data Architecture

!!! tip "Key Design Decisions"
    1. **Microservices Architecture**: 700+ independent services with clear ownership boundaries
    2. **Event-Driven Design**: Kafka-based event streaming for loose coupling and scalability  
    3. **Polyglot Persistence**: Multiple databases optimized for specific use cases (Cassandra, DynamoDB, MySQL)
    4. **Content Delivery Network**: Open Connect CDN with 15,000+ servers in ISP locations globally

## Failure Scenarios & Lessons

!!! danger "Major Incident: Christmas Eve 2012 AWS Outage"
    **What Happened**: AWS ELB service outage in US-East-1 took down Netflix streaming for several hours on Christmas Eve, affecting millions of users during peak viewing time.

    **Root Cause**: 
    - Single point of failure in AWS Elastic Load Balancer service
    - Netflix's dependency on single-region architecture at the time
    - Insufficient circuit breakers between critical services

    **Impact**: 
    - 6+ hours of streaming outages
    - Millions of users affected during holiday peak
    - Significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction
    - Public relations impact during high-visibility period

    **Lessons Learned**:
    1. **Embrace failure**: Led to development of chaos engineering practices and Chaos Monkey
    2. **Multi-region architecture**: Accelerated move to active-active multi-region deployment
    3. **Circuit breaker patterns**: Implemented comprehensive failure isolation mechanisms

!!! note
    **Deployment Frequency**: 4000+ deployments per day across all services
    **Rollout Strategy**: Canary deployments with automated rollback based on key metrics
    **Rollback Time**: < 10 minutes for critical services with automated rollback triggers
    **Feature Flags**: Extensive use for A/B testing and gradual feature rollouts

## Key Innovations

1. **Chaos Engineering**: Pioneered systematic failure injection to build resilient systems

## Takeaways for Your System

!!! quote "Key Lessons"
    1. **When to apply**: Microservices work well for large teams with clear service boundaries and independent deployment needs
    2. **When to avoid**: Don't start with microservices - begin with monolith and split when team size and complexity demand it
    3. **Cost considerations**: Expect 2-3x operational overhead but gain in development velocity and system resilience
    4. **Team requirements**: Need DevOps expertise, monitoring infrastructure, and culture that embraces failure

## Discussion Questions

1. How would Netflix's architecture change if they had to guarantee strong consistency for user viewing history?
2. What are the trade-offs between Netflix's microservices approach vs. a more monolithic architecture?
3. How does chaos engineering philosophy impact team culture and development practices?
4. Could Netflix's Open Connect CDN model work for other types of content beyond video streaming?
