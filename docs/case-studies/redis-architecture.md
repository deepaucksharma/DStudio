# Redis Architecture Deep Dive

> ðŸš§ This case study is planned for future development.

## Overview
This case study would provide a deep technical dive into Redis architecture, going beyond the basic Redis case study to explore internals like the event loop, data structures, persistence mechanisms, and cluster architecture.

## Key Technical Components
- Single-threaded event loop architecture
- Custom data structure implementations (SDS, ziplist, skiplist)
- RDB and AOF persistence mechanisms
- Redis Cluster: sharding and replication
- Redis Sentinel: high availability
- Module system and extensibility
