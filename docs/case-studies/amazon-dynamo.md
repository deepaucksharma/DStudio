|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **1. Latency** | <20ms database response globally | SSD + caching + local replicas | 5-10ms P99 latency |
| **2. Capacity** | 20M requests/sec at peak | Consistent hashing + auto-scaling | Linear scalability |
| **3. Failure** | Zero downtime requirement | Multi-AZ + hinted handoff | 99.999% availability |
| **4. Concurrency** | Conflicting writes | Vector clocks + reconciliation | Consistent resolution |
| **5. Coordination** | Cross-region sync | Gossip protocol + quorums | AP over CP choice |
| **6. Observability** | Performance monitoring | CloudWatch + X-Ray | Real-time insights |
| **7. Human Interface** | Developer experience | Simple API + SDKs | 5-minute setup |
| **8. Economics** | Cost at scale | Pay-per-request + reserved | 70% cost savings |

</div>

### üöÄ Axiom 1 (Latency): Physics-Based Design
```
Latency Budget Analysis:
- User tolerance: 100ms for page load
- Network: 50ms (coast-to-coast)
- Database: <20ms available
- Application: <30ms remaining

DynamoDB Solution:
- SSD storage: 1ms average access
- In-memory caching: 0.1ms
- Local replicas: Same AZ latency
- Result: 5-10ms database latency
```

### üì¶ Axiom 2 (Capacity): Infinite Scale Illusion
```
Scaling Requirements:
- Black Friday: 10x normal traffic
- Gradual ramp: 1M to 20M requests/sec
- No pre-provisioning needed

Implementation:
- Partition splits automatically
- Request routers update in real-time
- Admission control prevents overload
- Backpressure to applications
```

### üí• Axiom 3 (Failure): Always Available
```
Failure Scenarios:
- Node failures: 100s per day
- Rack failures: Weekly
- AZ failures: Quarterly
- Region failures: Rare but planned

Recovery Mechanisms:
- Hinted handoff for temporary failures
- Merkle trees for anti-entropy
- Read repair for inconsistencies
- Multi-region replication
```

### ‚è∞ Axiom 4 (Concurrency): Time is Relative
```
Concurrent Operations:
- Shopping cart updates from multiple devices
- Wish list modifications
- Session data changes

Resolution Strategy:
- Vector clocks track causality
- Application-level reconciliation
- Last-write-wins option available
- Conflict-free replicated data types
```

### ü§ù Axiom 5 (Coordination): Gossip over Consensus
```
Traditional Consensus Problems:
- Paxos requires majority (3/5 nodes)
- Network partition = unavailability
- Cross-region consensus = high latency

Dynamo's Innovation:
- Quorum reads/writes (R + W > N)
- Gossip-based membership
- Vector clocks for versioning
- Hinted handoff for recovery

Trade-off: Availability over consistency
```

### üëÅÔ∏è Axiom 6 (Observability): Operational Excellence
```
Monitoring Stack:
- CloudWatch metrics (latency, throughput)
- X-Ray for distributed tracing
- Contributor Insights for hot keys
- Alarms for anomalies

Key Metrics:
- UserErrors vs SystemErrors
- ConsumedReadCapacityUnits
- ThrottledRequests
- SuccessfulRequestLatency
```

### üë§ Axiom 7 (Human Interface): Developer First
```
API Design Principles:
- Simple put/get/delete operations
- Consistent error codes
- Clear throttling signals
- Predictable behavior

SDK Features:
- Automatic retries with backoff
- Connection pooling
- Request signing
- Local development mode
```

### üí∞ Axiom 8 (Economics): Pay for What You Use
```
Pricing Models:
- On-demand: No capacity planning
- Provisioned: Predictable costs
- Reserved capacity: 50%+ savings
- Auto-scaling: Best of both

Cost Optimizations:
- Compression reduces storage
- Batch operations save API calls
- GSIs for query flexibility
- TTL for automatic cleanup
```

## üîÑ The Dynamo Architecture

<div class="dynamo-architecture">
<h3>Consistent Hashing + Vector Clocks</h3>

**Consistent Hashing Ring:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Hash Ring (0-383)"
        A[Node A<br/>0-63]
        B[Node B<br/>64-127]
        C[Node C<br/>128-191]
        D[Node D<br/>192-255]
        E[Node E<br/>256-319]
        F[Node F<br/>320-383]
        
        A --> B
        B --> C
        C --> D
        D --> E
        E --> F
        F --> A
    end
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Hash Function: MD5(key) mod 384
Replication: Store on N=3 consecutive nodes
Virtual Nodes: 150 per physical node (for balance)

**Vector Clocks Example:**
```
Shopping Cart Conflict Resolution:

User's Phone:        Server Replica A:    Server Replica B:
Add iPhone [A:1]  ‚Üí  [A:1]               
                     ‚Üì
                  Add Case [A:1, B:1]  ‚Üí  [A:1, B:1]
Add AirPods [A:2] ‚Üí                       
                                      ‚Üê Network partition
                     
Conflict Detection:
- Phone: [A:2] (newer)
- Replica B: [A:1, B:1] (parallel update)
- Resolution: Merge both items (union)
- Final: iPhone + AirPods + Case
```
</div>

## üõ°Ô∏è Failure Handling Strategies

**Multi-Level Resilience**
```

- React: Cross-region failover
- Recover: Eventually consistent repair

Level 4: Correlated Failures
- Detect: Anomaly patterns
- React: Circuit breakers
- Recover: Manual intervention
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

<div class="performance-optimizations">
<h3>Speed Through Engineering</h3>

Solution: Request coalescing
1. Detect hot keys (>1000 RPS)
2. Cache responses locally  
3. Batch duplicate requests
4. Result: 10x reduction in backend load
```

**Read Performance:**
```
Optimization Stack:
1. Client-side caching (30 second TTL)
2. Regional read replicas
3. SSD storage with NVMe
4. Bloom filters for negative lookups
5. Compression (Snappy algorithm)

Result: P99 latency <5ms
```

**Write Performance:**
```
Write Path Optimization:

2. Asynchronous replication
3. Batch acknowledgments
4. Write-back caching

Result: 100k writes/second per node
```
</div>

## üéØ Key Design Decisions

<div class="design-decisions">
<h3>Critical Architecture Choices</h3>

**Decision 1: Availability over Consistency**
```
Problem: CAP theorem forces a choice

Options Evaluated:
1. Strong consistency (like traditional RDBMS)
   - Pros: ACID guarantees, simpler programming model
   - Cons: Availability suffers during partitions

2. Eventual consistency
   - Pros: Always available for writes
   - Cons: Complexity for developers

3. Tunable consistency
   - Pros: Flexibility per operation
   - Cons: Configuration complexity

Decision: Eventual consistency with tunable options
- Default: Eventually consistent reads
- Option: Strongly consistent reads (2x cost)
- Reasoning: Shopping cart can tolerate stale reads
```

**Decision 2: Consistent Hashing**
```
Problem: How to distribute data across nodes

Options:
1. Range-based partitioning
   - Pros: Simple, ordered scans
   - Cons: Hot spots, rebalancing pain

2. Hash-based partitioning
   - Pros: Even distribution
   - Cons: No range queries

3. Consistent hashing with virtual nodes
   - Pros: Incremental scaling, balanced load
   - Cons: Implementation complexity

Decision: Consistent hashing with virtual nodes
- 100+ virtual nodes per physical node
- MD5 hash for key distribution
- Enables incremental capacity changes
```

**Decision 3: Replication Strategy**
```
Problem: Ensuring durability and availability

Options:
1. Synchronous replication (all replicas)
   - Pros: Strong durability
   - Cons: High write latency

2. Asynchronous replication
   - Pros: Low latency
   - Cons: Potential data loss

3. Quorum-based (W + R > N)
   - Pros: Tunable trade-offs
   - Cons: Complex failure modes

Decision: Quorum with hinted handoff
- N=3 replicas standard
- W=2 for writes, R=1 for reads (eventual)
- R=2 for strong consistency
- Hinted handoff for temporary failures
```

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Consistent Hashing**: Enabled seamless scaling
2. **Vector Clocks**: Solved conflict resolution elegantly
3. **Quorum System**: Perfect balance of consistency/availability
4. **Managed Service**: Removed operational burden

### What Didn't Work
1. **Initial Query Model**: Too restrictive, added GSIs
2. **Fixed Provisioning**: Led to over/under provisioning
3. **Single Region**: Added global tables for compliance

### Key Takeaways
- **Design for failure**: Assume everything will fail
- **Eventual consistency is often enough**: Most apps can tolerate it
- **Operational simplicity matters**: Managed service wins
- **Monitor everything**: Can't optimize what you can't measure
