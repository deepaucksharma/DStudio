# Case Studies

## Real-World Applications

These case studies show how the axioms and patterns apply to complete systems.

## Available Studies

### Case Study Categories

**E-Commerce Systems** - Scale challenges and consistency trade-offs  
**High-Performance Systems** - Latency-constrained architectures  
**IoT and Edge** - Distributed coordination at scale

### Coming Soon

Detailed case studies showing axiom application:
- How companies scaled to millions of users
- Latency optimization strategies  
- Handling viral content distribution
- Edge computing architectures

## Study Format

Each case study follows this structure:
1. **Requirements** - Business and technical constraints
2. **Axiom Application** - Which constraints dominate
3. **Pattern Selection** - Why these patterns were chosen
4. **Trade-offs** - What was sacrificed for what benefits
5. **Lessons Learned** - Failures and improvements
