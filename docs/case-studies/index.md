**The Challenge**: Build a database that never goes down during Black Friday

<div class="case-study">
<h3>📊 System Requirements</h3>

**Scale Constraints:**
- 20M requests/second peak
- 99.995% availability (4.4 min/year downtime)
- Global distribution required
- Automatic failover under 100ms
- Eventually consistent acceptable

**Business Context:**
- Every minute down = $1M lost revenue
- Holiday traffic 10x normal load
- Customer trust is paramount

</div>

### Axiom Analysis Deep Dive

**🚀 Axiom 1 (Latency): Physics-Based Design**
```
Latency Budget Analysis:
- User tolerance: 100ms for page load
- Network: 50ms (coast-to-coast)
- Database: <20ms available
- Application: <30ms remaining

DynamoDB Solution:
- SSD storage: 1ms average access
- In-memory caching: 0.1ms

- Result: 5-10ms database latency
```

**🤝 Axiom 5 (Coordination): Gossip over Consensus**
```
Traditional Consensus Problems:
- Paxos requires majority (3/5 nodes)
- Network partition = unavailability
- Cross-region consensus = high latency

Dynamo's Innovation:
- Quorum reads/writes (R + W > N)
- Gossip-based membership
- Vector clocks for versioning
- Hinted handoff for recovery

Trade-off: Availability over consistency
```

### The Dynamo Architecture

<div class="dynamo-architecture">
<h3>🔄 Consistent Hashing + Vector Clocks</h3>

**Consistent Hashing Ring:**
```
           Node A (0-63)
               ↑
    Node F  ←     → Node B  
  (320-383)        (64-127)
       ↑               ↓
       ↑               ↓
  Node E ←           → Node C
 (256-319)          (128-191)
       ↑               ↓
       └── Node D ←────┘
          (192-255)

Hash Function: MD5(key) mod 384
Replication: Store on N=3 consecutive nodes
Virtual Nodes: 150 per physical node (for balance)
```

**Vector Clocks Example:**
```
Shopping Cart Conflict Resolution:

User's Phone:        Server Replica A:    Server Replica B:
Add iPhone [A:1]  →  [A:1]               
                     ↓
                  Add Case [A:1, B:1]  →  [A:1, B:1]
Add AirPods [A:2] →                       
                                      ← Network partition
                     
Conflict Detection:
- Phone: [A:2] (newer)
- Replica B: [A:1, B:1] (parallel update)
- Resolution: Merge both items (union)
- Final: iPhone + AirPods + Case
```
</div>

### Failure Handling Strategies
