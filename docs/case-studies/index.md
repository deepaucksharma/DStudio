## üìä Common Patterns Across Industries

### Architecture Evolution Patterns

| Stage | Characteristics | Common Solutions |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Startup** | Single server, <1K users | Monolith, RDBMS |
| **Growth** | 10K-100K users | Load balancers, read replicas |
| **Scale** | 1M+ users | Microservices, NoSQL |
| **Hyperscale** | 100M+ users | Cell architecture, edge computing |

### Trade-off Decisions

| System | Chose | Over | Because |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| **Uber** | Eventual consistency | Strong consistency | Real-time updates matter more |
| **DynamoDB** | Availability | Consistency | Can't lose sales |
| **PayPal** | Consistency | Speed | Money must be accurate |
| **Fortnite** | Client prediction | Server authority | Player experience |
| **SpaceX** | Triple redundancy | Cost savings | Human lives at stake |

### Key Success Factors

1. **Start Simple**: All systems began with straightforward architectures
2. **Measure Everything**: Data-driven decision making
3. **Plan for Failure**: Build resilience from day one
4. **Iterate Quickly**: Learn from production
5. **Automate Operations**: Reduce human error
