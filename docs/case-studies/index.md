## Framework Integration

Each case study demonstrates how real-world systems embody the principles outlined in our Distributed Systems Framework:

### Fundamental Laws Validation

### Pillar Analysis
- **Reliability**: Chaos engineering at Netflix, quorum systems at DynamoDB
- **Scalability**: Consistent hashing at DynamoDB, partitioning at Kafka
- **Availability**: Multi-region at Spanner, edge computing at Uber
- **Performance**: CDN at Netflix, spatial indexing at Uber
- **Consistency**: Vector clocks at DynamoDB, TrueTime at Spanner
- **Security**: Zero-trust at all systems, encryption at rest/transit

### Pattern Library Applications
Each case study extensively references and demonstrates patterns from our [Pattern Library](../pattern-library/), showing how abstract patterns manifest in production systems.

## Architecture Evolution Patterns

These case studies reveal common evolution patterns in distributed systems:

1. **Simple → Partitioned**: All systems started simple and added partitioning
2. **Synchronous → Asynchronous**: Migration to event-driven architectures
3. **Monolith → Microservices**: Service decomposition patterns
4. **Single Region → Multi-Region**: Geographic distribution strategies
5. **Manual → Automated**: Operations automation and chaos engineering
