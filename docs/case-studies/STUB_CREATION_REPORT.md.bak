# Case Study Stub Creation Report

## Summary
Created 9 stub files for the most frequently referenced but missing case studies.

## Case Study Stubs Created

### Location/Maps Category (8 files)
1. **uber-maps.md** - Uber's custom mapping infrastructure for ride-hailing
2. **apple-maps.md** - Apple's privacy-focused mapping architecture
3. **openstreetmap.md** - Crowdsourced distributed mapping infrastructure
4. **here-maps.md** - Automotive-focused mapping and HD maps
5. **find-my-device.md** - Apple/Google device location tracking systems
6. **snap-map.md** - Snapchat's real-time social location sharing
7. **life360.md** - Family location tracking and safety platform
8. **strava-heatmaps.md** - Activity heatmaps and privacy implications

### Architecture Category (1 file)
9. **redis-architecture.md** - Deep technical dive into Redis internals

## Prioritization Rationale

These case studies were prioritized because:

1. **High Reference Count**: All were referenced from existing case studies (google-maps.md, nearby-friends.md, key-value-store.md)

2. **Thematic Coherence**: The location/maps category forms a cohesive set that complements existing case studies and demonstrates different approaches to location services

3. **Educational Value**: Each represents a unique architectural approach:
   - Privacy-first (Apple Maps, Find My Device)
   - Crowdsourced (OpenStreetMap)
   - Industry-specific (HERE for automotive, Uber for ride-hailing)
   - Social features (Snap Map, Life360, Strava)
   - Technical deep-dive (Redis Architecture)

4. **Real-World Relevance**: These are major production systems that readers would benefit from understanding

## Template Structure Used

Each stub includes:
- Title and description metadata
- Overview section explaining what the case study would cover
- Key Challenges listing 5-6 major technical problems
- Related Case Studies with 3-4 cross-references
- External Resources with 2-3 official documentation links

## Next Steps

To complete these case studies, each would need:
- Detailed architecture diagrams
- Technical implementation details
- Performance and scale metrics
- Failure scenarios and solutions
- Code examples where applicable
- Visual components following the site's design system
