# Discord Voice Infrastructure Case Study

!!! abstract "Executive Summary"
    ðŸŽ¯ **Discord built custom WebRTC infrastructure to handle 5M+ concurrent voice users, achieving <100ms global latency through intelligent routing and edge optimization**

## At a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Concurrent Voice Users** | 5M+ (peak) |
| **Total Users** | 150M+ monthly active |
| **Voice Servers** | 10,000+ globally |
| **Average Latency** | <100ms (95th percentile) |
| **Packet Loss Tolerance** | Up to 40% |
| **Audio Codec** | Opus (variable bitrate) |

## Problem Statement & Constraints

### The Challenge
- Scale from gaming voice chat to general communication platform
- Maintain low latency for real-time conversation
- Handle diverse network conditions globally
- Support everything from 2-person calls to 1000+ person stages
- Zero perceived downtime during growth

### Constraints

### Intelligent Routing Algorithm

```python
# Simplified routing logic
class VoiceRouter:
    def find_optimal_server(self, user_locations: List[Location]) -> VoiceServer:
        # Build latency matrix
        latency_matrix = self.build_latency_matrix(user_locations)
        
        # Find server minimizing total latency
        best_server = None
        min_latency = float('inf')
        
        for server in self.available_servers:
            total_latency = 0
            for user_loc in user_locations:
                latency = self.estimate_latency(user_loc, server.location)
                # Penalize high latency exponentially
                total_latency += latency ** 1.5
            
            if total_latency < min_latency:
                min_latency = total_latency
                best_server = server
        
        return best_server
    
    def estimate_latency(self, loc1: Location, loc2: Location) -> float:
        # Haversine distance
        distance_km = haversine(loc1, loc2)
        
        # Account for speed of light in fiber (~200,000 km/s)
        # Plus routing overhead
        base_latency = (distance_km / 200000) * 1000  # ms
        routing_overhead = 10  # ms
        
        return base_latency + routing_overhead
```

## Key Patterns & Innovations

### 1. Voice Server Architecture

    subgraph "Voice Server Components"
        subgraph "Network Layer"
            UDP[UDP Socket]
            DTLS[DTLS Encryption]

    MON --> CTRL
    FAIL --> CTRL
    
    style MIX fill:#5865F2
    style CTRL fill:#EB459E
```

### 2. Adaptive Quality System

| Network Condition | Bitrate | FEC | Packet Size | Jitter Buffer |
|------------------|---------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| **Excellent** | 96 kbps | 0% | 20ms | 40ms |
| **Good** | 64 kbps | 10% | 20ms | 60ms |
| **Fair** | 32 kbps | 20% | 40ms | 100ms |
| **Poor** | 16 kbps | 40% | 60ms | 200ms |

### 3. Seamless Failover

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Connected: Join Voice
    Connected --> Detecting: Server Issue
    
    Detecting --> Migrating: Failover Triggered
    Detecting --> Connected: False Alarm
    
    Migrating --> Reconnecting: New Server Selected
    Reconnecting --> Connected: Migration Complete
    Reconnecting --> Fallback: Migration Failed
    
    Fallback --> Connected: Retry Success
    Fallback --> Disconnected: Give Up
    
    Connected --> [*]: Leave Voice
    Disconnected --> [*]
```

## Scaling Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Global Latency

graph TB
    subgraph "Problem"
        P1[Users Worldwide]
        P2[Physics Limits]
        P3[Network Variability]
    end

    P3 --> S3 --> R3
    
    style S1,S2,S3 fill:#5865F2
    style R1,R2,R3 fill:#57F287
```

### Challenge 2: Resource Efficiency

| Problem | Solution | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **CPU Usage** | SIMD optimized mixing | 70% reduction |
| **Bandwidth** | Selective forwarding | 60% savings |
| **Memory** | Ring buffer pooling | 50% reduction |
| **Latency** | Kernel bypass networking | 30% improvement |

### Challenge 3: Quality at Scale

```python
# Audio mixing optimization
class OptimizedMixer:
    def mix_audio_streams(self, streams: List[AudioStream]) -> bytes:
        # Use SIMD instructions for parallel processing
        mixed = np.zeros(FRAME_SIZE, dtype=np.int16)
        
        # Group by similar volume levels for cache efficiency
        grouped = self.group_by_volume(streams)
        
        for group in grouped:
            # Vectorized mixing
            group_audio = np.array([s.data for s in group])
            mixed += np.sum(group_audio, axis=0)
        
        # Clipping prevention
        mixed = np.clip(mixed, -32768, 32767)
        
        return mixed.tobytes()
```

   def max_possible_latency(distance_km):
       speed_of_light_fiber = 200000  # km/s
       return (distance_km / speed_of_light_fiber) * 1000  # ms
   ```

   - Monitor network continuously
   - Adjust quality proactively
   - Prioritize consistency over peak quality
