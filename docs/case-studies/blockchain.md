# Key metrics
metrics:
  users: 100M+
  requests_per_second: 10K+
  data_volume: 1TB+
  availability: 99.9%
  latency_p99: 10min
  regions: 100+

# Pattern usage tracking
patterns_used:
  gold:
    - consensus-algorithms: "Proof of Work/Stake for agreement"
    - merkle-trees: "Efficient transaction verification"
    - cryptographic-hashing: "Chain integrity and mining"
  silver:
    - gossip-protocol: "Block propagation across network"
    - eventual-consistency: "Network-wide state agreement"
  bronze:
    - proof-of-work: "Energy-intensive consensus"
    - blockchain-forks: "Network splits and reorganization"
    - transaction-fees: "Economic incentive model"

# Excellence connections
excellence_guides:
  - scale/blockchain-infrastructure
  - migration/blockchain-considerations
  - operational/decentralized-systems

# Implementation insights
key_innovations:
  - "Decentralized consensus without central authority"
  - "Immutable ledger through cryptographic chaining"
  - "Economic incentives align with security"

lessons_learned:
  - category: "Scalability"
    lesson: "Consensus mechanisms limit transaction throughput"
  - category: "Energy"
    lesson: "Proof of Work consumes massive energy"
  - category: "Adoption"
    lesson: "Technical complexity limits mainstream use"

# Bronze tier specific metadata
modern_alternatives:
  - name: "Distributed Databases"
    description: "Traditional consensus with better performance"
    when_to_use: "When trust exists between parties"
  - name: "Event Sourcing"
    description: "Immutable audit logs without blockchain"
    when_to_use: "When centralized control is acceptable"
  - name: "Consortium Blockchains"
    description: "Permissioned networks with known validators"
    when_to_use: "For enterprise use cases"

deprecation_reason: "High energy consumption, limited throughput, and complexity make public blockchains unsuitable for most enterprise use cases. Private/consortium blockchains offer better trade-offs."

migration_guide:
  from: "Public blockchain"
  to: "Event sourcing + distributed database"
  steps:
    - "Identify actual requirements (immutability, decentralization, etc.)"
    - "Evaluate if traditional databases meet needs"
    - "Consider consortium blockchains for multi-party scenarios"
    - "Implement event sourcing for audit trails"
