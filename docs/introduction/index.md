# About This Compendium

[Home](/) > [Introduction](/introduction/) > About This Compendium

!!! quote "Our Philosophy"
 This compendium teaches distributed systems from first principlesâ€”starting with physics and mathematics rather than specific technologies.

 **Why?** Technologies change. Physics doesn't.

## What You'll Learn

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-atom:{ .lg .middle } **7 Fundamental Laws**

    ---

    Advanced framework from physics, mathematics, and complexity theory that governs all distributed systems.

- :material-pillar:{ .lg .middle } **5 Core Pillars**

    ---

    How the fundamental laws combine to create architectural challenges and solution patterns.

- :material-shield-check:{ .lg .middle } **Battle-tested Patterns**

    ---

    Solutions derived from first principles, not fashion - patterns that work across any technology.

- :material-calculator-variant:{ .lg .middle } **Quantitative Tools**

    ---

    Mathematical frameworks and calculators to make decisions with data, not opinions.
