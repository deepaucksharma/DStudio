# About This Compendium

## Our Philosophy

This compendium teaches distributed systems from first principles—starting with physics and mathematics rather than specific technologies.

**Why?** Technologies change. Physics doesn't.

## What You'll Learn

- **7 Fundamental Laws** - Advanced framework from physics, mathematics, and complexity theory
  - Law 1: Failure ⛓️
  - Law 2: Asynchronous Reality ⏳
  - Law 3: Emergence 🌪️
  - Law 4: Trade-offs ⚖️
  - Law 5: Epistemology 🧠
  - Law 6: Human-API 🤯
  - Law 7: Economics 💰
- **5 Foundational Pillars** - How laws combine to create architectural challenges  
- **Battle-tested Patterns** - Solutions derived from first principles, not fashion
- **Quantitative Tools** - Make decisions with math, not opinions

## Who This Is For

- **Engineers** building distributed systems
- **Architects** designing at scale
- **Leaders** making technical decisions
- **Students** learning fundamentals

## How to Use This Resource

1. **Start with Laws** if you want deep understanding
2. **Jump to Patterns** if you have immediate problems
3. **Use Tools** for capacity planning and calculations
4. **Study Case Studies** to learn from real failures
