# About This Compendium

!!! quote "Our Philosophy"
 This compendium teaches distributed systems from first principles—starting with physics and mathematics rather than specific technologies.

 **Why?** Technologies change. Physics doesn't.

## What You'll Learn

<div class="grid" markdown>
 <div class="card">
 <h3 class="card__title">7 Fundamental Laws</h3>
 <p class="card__description">
 Advanced framework from physics, mathematics, and complexity theory that governs all distributed systems.
 </p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="card">
 <h3 class="card__title">5 Core Pillars</h3>
 <p class="card__description">
 How the fundamental laws combine to create architectural challenges and solution patterns.
 </p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="card">
 <h3 class="card__title">Battle-tested Patterns</h3>
 <p class="card__description">
