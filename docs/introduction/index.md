# Introduction

!!! abstract "Welcome to The Compendium"
    A revolutionary approach to understanding distributed systems through first principles rather than memorizing patterns.

## What Makes This Different?

This isn't another distributed systems book that starts with Kafka, Kubernetes, or consensus algorithms. Instead, we begin with the fundamental constraints that govern all distributed systems:

- **Physics**: The speed of light creates latency
- **Mathematics**: Queueing theory determines capacity  
- **Economics**: Every decision has a cost
- **Human Nature**: People are part of the system

## Quick Start by Role

=== "New Graduate"
    
    1. Start with [Philosophy](philosophy.md) to understand the approach
    2. Follow the [Green Line roadmap](roadmap.md#new-graduate-path)
    3. Focus on Axioms 1-3 first
    4. Do all the "Try This" exercises

=== "Senior Engineer"
    
    1. Review the [Philosophy](philosophy.md) 
    2. Jump to [All Axioms](../part1-axioms/index.md)
    3. Study the mathematical proofs
    4. Apply patterns to your systems

=== "Engineering Manager"
    
    1. Read the [Preface](preface.md) for context
    2. Follow the [Orange Line roadmap](roadmap.md#manager-path)
    3. Focus on cost and human factors
    4. Use decision frameworks for reviews

=== "Architect"
    
    1. Start with [Part II: Pillars](../part2-pillars/index.md)
    2. Study axiom interactions
    3. Review all decision trees
    4. Examine failure vignettes

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this journey, you'll understand:

- Why distributed systems behave the way they do
- How to derive solutions from first principles
- When to use which patterns (and why)
- How to make quantitative trade-offs
- Why some "best practices" are actually worst practices
