# Prerequisites Check

!!! info "Quick Check"
    This guide will help you assess whether you're ready to dive into the Compendium or if you should brush up on some fundamentals first.

## Minimum Prerequisites

### ✅ Required Knowledge

You should be comfortable with these concepts:

- **Basic Programming**: Can write and debug code in at least one language
- **Client-Server Model**: Understand how web applications work
- **Databases**: Know what a database is and basic SQL
- **Networks**: Understand IP addresses, DNS, HTTP

### 🎯 Self-Assessment Quiz

!!! question "Test Your Readiness"
    Answer these questions to gauge your preparedness:

    1. **What happens when you type google.com in your browser?**
       - If you can explain DNS resolution, TCP handshake, and HTTP request/response, you're ready! ✅
       - If not, review basic networking first 📚

    2. **What's the difference between a thread and a process?**
       - If you understand memory isolation and context switching, great! ✅
       - If not, review operating systems basics 📚

    3. **What is Big O notation?**
       - If you can analyze basic algorithm complexity, proceed! ✅
       - If not, review data structures and algorithms 📚

    4. **Have you built any multi-user application?**
       - If yes, you'll relate to many examples! ✅
       - If not, you can still learn, but some examples may be abstract 📚

## Knowledge Levels

### 🌱 Beginner Level
**You are here if:**
- Recently graduated or new to backend development
- Can code but haven't built distributed systems
- Understand basic CS concepts

**Recommended path:** Start with [New Graduate Learning Path](roadmap.md#new-graduate-path)

### 🌿 Intermediate Level
**You are here if:**
- 2-5 years of backend experience
- Have worked with microservices
- Debugged production issues
- Used message queues, caches, or load balancers

**Recommended path:** Start with [All Axioms](../part1-axioms/index.md), then dive deep into specific topics

### 🌳 Advanced Level
**You are here if:**
- 5+ years building distributed systems
- Have designed systems handling significant scale
- Understand CAP theorem and consistency models
- Have dealt with split-brain scenarios

**Recommended path:** Use as reference, jump to [advanced patterns](../part2-pillars/index.md)

## Helpful but Not Required

### 🎓 Academic Background
- **Mathematics**: Probability and statistics help with failure analysis
- **Physics**: Understanding of speed of light and thermodynamics enriches axioms
- **Queuing Theory**: Helpful for capacity planning but we'll teach what you need

### 🛠️ Technical Experience
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS/GCP/Azure experience helps relate to examples
- **Containers**: Docker/Kubernetes knowledge useful but not essential
- **Monitoring**: Experience with observability tools is a plus

## Prerequisite Resources

### 📚 If You Need to Catch Up

**Networking Basics:**
- [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Kurose-Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach-7th-Edition/PGM1101673.html)
- [High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/) (free online)

**Operating Systems:**
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) (free online)
- Focus on: Processes, Threads, Synchronization

**Algorithms & Data Structures:**
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) (CLRS)
- Focus on: Complexity analysis, basic data structures

**Databases:**
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) (Kleppmann)
- First 3 chapters provide excellent foundation

## Ready to Start?

### ✅ Quick Readiness Checklist

- [ ] I can explain how the internet works at a high level
- [ ] I understand the difference between latency and bandwidth
- [ ] I know what a race condition is
- [ ] I've used at least one database
- [ ] I can read and understand basic code examples
- [ ] I'm curious about why systems fail

**Scored 4+ checks?** You're ready! Head to [Learning Paths](roadmap.md)

**Scored 2-3 checks?** You can start but may need to reference external resources

**Scored 0-1 checks?** Consider building a few small projects first

## Don't Let This Intimidate You!

!!! success "Remember"
    The Compendium is designed to teach from first principles. We'll explain physics and math concepts as needed. The most important prerequisite is **curiosity** and **willingness to think deeply** about system behavior.

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Don't worry about understanding everything immediately. Distributed systems mastery comes from building mental models over time. Start with one axiom and let understanding compound.
