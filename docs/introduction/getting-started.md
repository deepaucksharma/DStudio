# Getting Started with Distributed Systems

!!! info
 <h2>Welcome to Your Journey</h2>
 <p>A revolutionary approach to learning distributed systems that starts with the laws of physics rather than specific technologies.</p>

!!! quote "Why This Compendium is Different"
 - **Physics-First**: We derive patterns from fundamental constraints like the speed of light
 - **Technology-Agnostic**: Principles that apply to any distributed system
 - **Battle-Tested**: Real production failures illustrate every concept
 - **Multiple Paths**: Tailored learning for different roles and experience levels

## Our Approach vs Traditional Learning

<div class="grid" markdown>
 <div class="card">
 <h3 class="card__title">Traditional Approach</h3>
 <p class="card__description">
 Start with tools (Kafka, Redis, Kubernetes). Problem: Technologies become obsolete in 3-5 years.
 </p>

 <div class="card">
 <h3 class="card__title">Our Physics-First Philosophy</h3>
 <p class="card__description">
 Start with immutable laws of physics and derive solutions. Benefit: Understanding that transcends technology.

## Study Tips

!!! tip "Active Learning Strategies"
| Strategy | What to Do | Why It Works |
 |----------|------------|--------------|
 | **Predict** | Before reading, guess what patterns emerge | Activates prior knowledge |
 | **Connect** | Map concepts to your experience | Creates lasting memories |
 | **Teach** | Explain concepts to others | Tests understanding |
 | **Build** | Implement patterns yourself | Develops practical skills |


!!! note "Build Your Portfolio"
 - **Document insights** as you learn
 - **Implement patterns** in code
 - **Break things intentionally** to see failures
 - **Share knowledge** with your team

## Quick Navigation

!!! tip "Start Based on Your Immediate Need"
| If You Need | Go To | Why |
 |-------------|-------|-----|
 | **Solve Problem Now** | [Pattern Catalog](../patterns/) | Find proven solutions |
 | **Deep Understanding** | [Law 1 - Failure](../part1-axioms/law1-failure/) | Build from fundamentals |
 | **Design System** | [Pattern Selector](../patterns/pattern-selector/) | Make informed choices |
 | **Capacity Planning** | [Calculators](../quantitative/) | Quantify decisions |
 | **Learn from Failures** | [Case Studies](../case-studies/) | Avoid known pitfalls |


### Reading Order Options

| Goal | Recommended Order |
|------|------------------|
| **Maximum Understanding** | Laws 1-7 → Synthesis → Patterns → Case Studies |
| **Practical Application** | Relevant Pattern → Underlying Laws → Case Studies |
| **Quick Reference** | Pattern Selector → Cheat Sheets → Glossary |


## Common Learning Pitfalls

!!! danger "Avoid These Mistakes"
| Don't Do This | Do This Instead |
 |---------------|-----------------|
 | Skip fundamentals | Review laws deeply, find new insights |
 | Just memorize patterns | Understand why, derive from principles |
 | Ignore failure stories | Study failures, learn from others |
 | Work in isolation | Collaborate, share, and discuss |


## Ready to Start?

!!! tip "Your Quick Start Checklist"
 1. **Check Prerequisites**: Do you have basic programming, networking, and database knowledge?
 2. **Choose Your Path**: Pick the learning path that matches your experience level
 3. **Set Schedule**: Block 5-15 hours per week for focused study
 4. **Begin**: Start with [Law 1: Correlated Failure](../part1-axioms/law1-failure/)
