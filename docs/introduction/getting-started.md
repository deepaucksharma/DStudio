# Getting Started with Distributed Systems

!!! info
 <h2>Welcome to Your Journey</h2>
 <p>A revolutionary approach to learning distributed systems that starts with the laws of physics rather than specific technologies.</p>

!!! quote "Why This Compendium is Different"
 - **Physics-First**: We derive patterns from fundamental constraints like the speed of light
 - **Technology-Agnostic**: Principles that apply to any distributed system
 - **Battle-Tested**: Real production failures illustrate every concept
 - **Multiple Paths**: Tailored learning for different roles and experience levels

## Our Approach vs Traditional Learning

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-tools:{ .lg .middle } **Traditional Approach**
    
    ---
    
    Start with tools (Kafka, Redis, Kubernetes). Problem: Technologies become obsolete in 3-5 years.

- :material-atom:{ .lg .middle } **Our Physics-First Philosophy**
    
    ---
    
    Start with immutable laws of physics and derive solutions. Benefit: Understanding that transcends technology.

| Don't Do This | Do This Instead |
 |---------------|-----------------|
 | Skip fundamentals | Review laws deeply, find new insights |
 | Just memorize patterns | Understand why, derive from principles |
 | Ignore failure stories | Study failures, learn from others |
 | Work in isolation | Collaborate, share, and discuss |


## Ready to Start?

!!! tip "Your Quick Start Checklist"
