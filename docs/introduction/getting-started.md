# Getting Started with Distributed Systems

## Welcome to Your Journey

Welcome to **The Compendium of Distributed Systems** - a revolutionary approach to learning distributed systems that starts with the laws of physics rather than specific technologies. Whether you're a new graduate, an experienced engineer, or a technical leader, this guide will help you navigate your learning journey.

!!! tip "Why This Compendium is Different"
    - **Physics-First**: We derive patterns from fundamental constraints like the speed of light
    - **Technology-Agnostic**: Principles that apply to any distributed system
    - **Battle-Tested**: Real production failures illustrate every concept
    - **Multiple Paths**: Tailored learning for different roles and experience levels

## Understanding Our Unique Approach

### The Problem with Traditional Learning

Most distributed systems education starts with tools and technologies:
- "Here's how to use Kafka"
- "This is how Redis works"
- "Deploy this on Kubernetes"

**The problem?** Technologies change. What you learn today may be obsolete in 5 years.

### Our Physics-First Philosophy

We start with immutable laws of physics and derive everything else:

    B --> C[Distributed Systems Laws]
    C --> D[Architectural Patterns]
    D --> E[Technology Choices]
    
    style A fill:#5448C8,color:#fff
    style C fill:#5448C8,color:#fff
```

**The benefit?** Understanding that transcends any specific technology.

## Key Sections Overview

### 🏛️ Part 1: The 7 Fundamental Laws

Our advanced framework presents 7 laws that govern all distributed systems:

1. **[Correlated Failure](../part1-axioms/axiom1-failure/index.md)** - Failures cascade and correlate
2. **[Asynchronous Reality](../part1-axioms/axiom2-asynchrony/index.md)** - No shared time, only happens-before
3. **[Emergent Chaos](../part1-axioms/axiom3-emergence/index.md)** - Complexity breeds unpredictability
4. **[Multidimensional Optimization](../part1-axioms/axiom4-tradeoffs/index.md)** - Every choice has ripple effects
5. **[Distributed Knowledge](../part1-axioms/axiom5-epistemology/index.md)** - Truth is local and uncertain
6. **[Cognitive Load](../part1-axioms/axiom6-human-api/index.md)** - Human understanding has limits
7. **[Economic Reality](../part1-axioms/axiom7-economics/index.md)** - Resources shape all decisions

### 🔧 Patterns & Solutions

Over 50 battle-tested patterns organized by problem domain:

- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, retries, failover
