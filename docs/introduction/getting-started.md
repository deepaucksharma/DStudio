# Getting Started with Distributed Systems

## Welcome to Your Journey

Welcome to **The Compendium of Distributed Systems** - a revolutionary approach to learning distributed systems that starts with the laws of physics rather than specific technologies. Whether you're a new graduate, an experienced engineer, or a technical leader, this guide will help you navigate your learning journey.

!!! tip "Why This Compendium is Different"
    - **Physics-First**: We derive patterns from fundamental constraints like the speed of light
    - **Technology-Agnostic**: Principles that apply to any distributed system
    - **Battle-Tested**: Real production failures illustrate every concept
    - **Multiple Paths**: Tailored learning for different roles and experience levels

## Understanding Our Unique Approach

### The Problem with Traditional Learning

Most distributed systems education starts with tools and technologies:
- "Here's how to use Kafka"
- "This is how Redis works"
- "Deploy this on Kubernetes"

**The problem?** Technologies change. What you learn today may be obsolete in 5 years.

### Our Physics-First Philosophy

We start with immutable laws of physics and derive everything else:

    C --> D[Architectural Patterns]
    D --> E[Technology Choices]

    style C fill:#5448C8,color:#fff
```

**The benefit?** Understanding that transcends any specific technology.

## Prerequisites and Background

### Essential Prerequisites

Before diving deep, ensure you have:

1. **Basic Programming Experience**
   - Any language is fine
   - Understanding of functions, data structures, loops

2. **Elementary Networking Concepts**
   - What is a network request?
   - Basic client-server model
   - HTTP fundamentals

3. **Basic Database Knowledge**

   - Concept of transactions

### Helpful but Not Required

- Operating systems concepts
- Algorithms and data structures
- Probability and statistics
- Linear algebra (for advanced topics)

!!! note "Don't Have All Prerequisites?"
    Don't worry! Each section clearly marks its prerequisites. You can learn missing concepts as you go.

Our advanced framework presents 7 laws that govern all distributed systems:

1. **[Correlated Failure](../part1-axioms/axiom1-failure/index.md)** - Failures cascade and correlate
2. **[Asynchronous Reality](../part1-axioms/axiom2-asynchrony/index.md)** - No shared time, only happens-before
3. **[Emergent Chaos](../part1-axioms/axiom3-emergence/index.md)** - Complexity breeds unpredictability
4. **[Multidimensional Optimization](../part1-axioms/axiom4-tradeoffs/index.md)** - Every choice has ripple effects
5. **[Distributed Knowledge](../part1-axioms/axiom5-epistemology/index.md)** - Truth is local and uncertain
6. **[Cognitive Load](../part1-axioms/axiom6-human-api/index.md)** - Human understanding has limits
7. **[Economic Reality](../part1-axioms/axiom7-economics/index.md)** - Resources shape all decisions

## Getting the Most from This Resource

### Active Learning Strategies

1. **Predict Before Reading**
   - Given a law, what patterns might emerge?
   - How would violating it cause failures?

2. **Map to Experience**
   - Where have you seen these laws in action?
   - What systems violate these principles?

3. **Explain to Others**
   - Can you teach this concept simply?
   - Where are the gaps in your understanding?

### Practical Exercises

Each section includes:

- **Thought Experiments**: "What would happen if..."
- **Design Challenges**: "Build a system that..."
- **Failure Analysis**: "Why did this break?"
- **Trade-off Decisions**: "Choose between..."

### Building Your Portfolio

As you progress:

1. **Document Your Journey**
   - Keep notes on key insights
   - Track which laws apply to your work
   - Record your design decisions

2. **Implement Examples**
   - Code the patterns you learn
   - Build toy versions of systems
   - Break things intentionally

3. **Share Knowledge**
   - Write about your learnings
   - Present to your team
   - Contribute improvements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Skip the Fundamentals

Even experienced engineers benefit from reviewing the laws. They provide vocabulary and frameworks for discussing complex trade-offs.

### ‚ùå Don't Just Memorize

Understanding why patterns exist is more valuable than memorizing their implementation.

### ‚ùå Don't Ignore Failures

The failure stories contain the most valuable lessons. Study them carefully.

### ‚ùå Don't Work in Isolation

Distributed systems are team efforts. Share your learning, discuss trade-offs, and learn from others.
