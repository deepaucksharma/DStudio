## Express Route ðŸ”´ {#express-route}

### When to Use
- Solving immediate problem
- Preparing for interview
- Quick architecture review
- Technology evaluation

### How It Works

1. **Identify Your Constraint**
   - Use the [Axiom Spider Chart](../part1-axioms/index.md#spider-chart)
   - Find dominant constraint

2. **Jump to Solution**
   - Follow relevant decision tree
   - Read specific pattern
   - Review similar failures

3. **Apply Immediately**
   - Use provided formulas
   - Implement suggested fix
   - Measure improvement

### Example: "Our API is too slow"

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API is slow] --> B{Where is time spent?}
    B -->|Network| C[Axiom 1: Latency]
    B -->|Processing| D[Axiom 2: Capacity]
    B -->|Coordination| E[Axiom 5: Coordination]
    C --> F[Add regional caches]
    D --> G[Scale horizontally]
    E --> H[Reduce consistency]
```

## Custom Paths

### By Problem Domain

| Domain | Focus Areas | Key Patterns |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **E-commerce** | Axioms 1,2,3,8 | Caching, eventual consistency |
| **Finance** | Axioms 3,4,5 | Strong consistency, transactions |
| **Gaming** | Axioms 1,2 | Edge computing, state sync |
| **Analytics** | Axioms 2,5,8 | Batch processing, cost optimization |
| **Social** | Axioms 2,3,6 | Feed generation, partial failures |

### By Technology Stack

| Stack | Relevant Sections | Special Considerations |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Kubernetes** | Control planes, orchestration | Container scheduling |
| **Serverless** | Cost models, cold starts | Event-driven patterns |
