## Conclusion

The site has strong foundational content with the 7 laws and current patterns, but needs significant expansion in:
1. **Blockchain and distributed ledgers** (completely missing)
2. **ML infrastructure patterns** (minimal coverage)
3. **Advanced consensus algorithms** (partially covered)
4. **Quantum computing implications** (not covered)
