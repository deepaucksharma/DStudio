## Core Mental Models

### 1. The Physics Model 🌌

<div class="model-box">

**Think of distributed systems as bound by physical laws**

Just as you can't exceed the speed of light or create energy from nothing, distributed systems have inviolable constraints:

- **Distance = Delay** (speed of light)
- **Finite Resources** (conservation of energy)
- **Entropy Increases** (things tend toward disorder)
- **Uncertainty Principle** (can't know everything perfectly)

**Application**: When designing, always ask "What would physics say?"

</div>

### 2. The Organization Model 🏢

<div class="model-box">

**Think of distributed systems as human organizations**

Systems face the same challenges as companies:

- **Communication overhead** (meetings = network calls)
- **Coordination costs** (management = consensus)
- **Departmental silos** (services = teams)
- **Politics and turf wars** (resource contention)

**Application**: If it's hard for humans to coordinate, it's hard for computers too.

</div>

### 3. The City Planning Model 🏙️

<div class="model-box">

**Think of distributed systems as cities**

- **Roads** = Network connections
- **Buildings** = Services
- **Traffic** = Request flow
- **Utilities** = Shared infrastructure
- **Zoning** = Service boundaries

**Application**: Urban planning principles apply to system architecture.

</div>

### 4. The Biological Model 🧬

<div class="model-box">

**Think of distributed systems as living organisms**

- **Cells** = Individual services
- **Organs** = Service clusters
- **Nervous system** = Control plane
- **Immune system** = Security/defense
- **Evolution** = System adaptation

**Application**: Biological systems have solved distributed coordination for millions of years.

</div>

## Trade-off Models

### 5. The CAP Triangle 🔺

<div class="model-box">

```
         Consistency
             /\
            /  \
           /    \
          /      \
    Availability  Partition Tolerance
```

**Choose two, sacrifice one** (in the presence of network partitions)

- **CA**: Single-node databases (no partition tolerance)
- **CP**: Distributed databases with strong consistency
- **AP**: Eventually consistent systems

**Reality**: It's more of a spectrum than absolute choices.

</div>

### 6. The Iron Triangle of Systems ⚠️

<div class="model-box">

```
         Fast
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \
   Cheap -- Good
```

**Pick two:**
- **Fast + Good** = Expensive
- **Fast + Cheap** = Not good
- **Good + Cheap** = Not fast

**Application**: Every architectural decision involves this trade-off.

</div>

### 7. The Latency Hierarchy Ladder 🪜

<div class="model-box">

```
L1 Cache         1 ns       |
L2 Cache        10 ns       ||
RAM            100 ns       ||||
SSD           10 µs        ||||||
HDD          10 ms         ||||||||
Network      100 ms        ||||||||||
Human       1000 ms        ||||||||||||
```

**Each step is ~10-100x slower**

**Application**: Know where your data lives and how far it must travel.

</div>

## System Behavior Models

### 8. The Thundering Herd 🦬

<div class="model-box">

**When synchronized behavior causes cascading failures**

```
Normal:     . . . . . . . . .
            . . . . . . . . .
            
Thundering: ................
            ________________
```

**Examples**:
- Cache expiry at same time
- Retry storms
- Synchronized polling

**Application**: Add jitter to prevent synchronization.

</div>

### 9. The Cascading Failure Domino 🁁

<div class="model-box">

**One failure triggers others in sequence**

```
A healthy → A fails → B overloaded → B fails → C overloaded → ...
```

**Prevention**:
- Circuit breakers
- Bulkheads
- Load shedding
- Backpressure

</div>

### 10. The Split Brain 🧠

<div class="model-box">

**When a system can't agree on who's in charge**

```
Network Partition:
[A, B] <--X--> [C, D]
   ↓               ↓
"I'm the         "No, I'm
 leader!"         the leader!"
```

**Solutions**:
- Odd number of nodes
- Quorum-based decisions
- Fencing tokens
- Generation numbers

</div>

## Capacity Models

### 11. The Bathtub Curve 🛁

<div class="model-box">

**System failure rate over time**

```
Failure
Rate  |
      |\        /|
      | \      / |
      |  \____/  |
      |__________|
      Early  Useful  Wear
      Failure Life   Out
```

**Implications**:
- New systems fail often (bugs)
- Stable period (random failures)
- Old systems degrade (wear)

</div>

### 12. The Hockey Stick of Death 🏒

<div class="model-box">

**Performance degradation at high utilization**

```
Response
Time    |       /
        |      /
        |     /
        |____/
        |________|
        0%     70%   100%
           Utilization
```

**Key insight**: Performance cliffs around 70-80% utilization.

</div>

### 13. Little's Law Queue 📊

<div class="model-box">

**L = λ × W**

Where:
- L = Average number of items in system
- λ = Average arrival rate
- W = Average time in system

**Example**: 
- 100 requests/second arriving
- 50ms average processing time
- = 5 requests in system on average

**Application**: Predict queue depths and set limits.

</div>

## Coordination Models

### 14. The Byzantine Generals 👑

<div class="model-box">

**Achieving consensus with unreliable participants**

```
General 1: "Attack at dawn"
    ↓
Messenger (might be traitor)
    ↓
General 2: "Did he say attack or retreat?"
```

**Problem**: How to agree when messages and messengers can't be trusted?

**Solutions**: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms

</div>

### 15. The Two-Phase Commit Dance 💃

<div class="model-box">

**Coordinating distributed transactions**

```
Phase 1 - Voting:
Coordinator: "Can you commit?"
Participants: "Yes" or "No"

Phase 2 - Decision:
If all "Yes": "Commit!"
If any "No": "Abort!"
```

**Weakness**: Coordinator failure leaves system in limbo.

</div>

### 16. The Gossip Protocol Telephone 📞

<div class="model-box">

**Information spreads like rumors**

```
Round 1: A tells B
Round 2: A tells C, B tells D
Round 3: A tells E, B tells F, C tells G, D tells H
...
```

**Properties**:
- Exponential spread
- Eventually consistent
- Resilient to failures
- No single point of failure

</div>

## Time Models

### 17. The Lamport Clock ⏰

<div class="model-box">

**Logical time when physical time can't be trusted**

```
Process A: 1 ----3----> 4
              ↘     ↗
Process B: 1 ---2-----> 5
```

**Rules**:
1. Increment on local event
2. On receive, take max(local, received) + 1

**Application**: Order events without synchronized clocks.

</div>

### 18. The Vector Clock 🕐

<div class="model-box">

**Track causality across multiple processes**

```
A: [1,0,0] → [2,0,0] → [3,2,0]
                ↓         ↑
B: [0,1,0] → [2,2,0] → [2,3,0]
                          ↓
C: [0,0,1] → [0,0,2] → [2,3,3]
```

**Each process tracks all clocks, updates own**

**Application**: Detect concurrent vs causal events.

</div>

## Data Models

### 19. The Eventually Consistent Reconciliation 🤝

<div class="model-box">

**Conflicts are inevitable, plan for resolution**

```
Node A: value = "X"
         ↓ (network partition)
Node A: value = "Y"
Node B: value = "Z"
         ↓ (partition heals)
Reconcile: value = ???
```

**Strategies**:
- Last Write Wins (LWW)
- Version vectors
- CRDTs
- Application-specific merge

</div>

### 20. The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) 📝

<div class="model-box">

**Durability through sequential writes**

```
1. Write intent to log
2. Fsync log to disk
3. Apply change to data
4. Acknowledge to client

On crash: Replay log
```

**Why it works**: Sequential writes are fast, random writes are slow.

</div>

## Operational Models

### 21. The Cattle vs Pets 🐄🐕

<div class="model-box">

**Pets**: Servers you name and care for individually
- Manually configured
- Hard to replace
- Scaled vertically

**Cattle**: Servers that are interchangeable
- Automatically configured
- Easy to replace
- Scaled horizontally

**Modern approach**: Treat servers like cattle, not pets.

</div>

### 22. The Swiss Cheese Model 🧀

<div class="model-box">

**Multiple layers of defense, each with holes**

```
Threat → | ○ ● ○ | → | ● ○ ● | → | ○ ● ○ | → Stopped
         Layer 1    Layer 2    Layer 3
```

**No single layer is perfect, but combined they provide protection**

**Application**: Defense in depth for security and reliability.

</div>

## Performance Models

### 23. Amdahl's Law 📈

<div class="model-box">

**The speedup limit of parallelization**

```
Speedup = 1 / (S + P/N)

Where:
- S = Serial portion (can't parallelize)
- P = Parallel portion
- N = Number of processors
```

**Example**: If 25% is serial, max speedup is 4x, regardless of processors.

</div>

### 24. The Universal Scalability Law 📊

<div class="model-box">

**Real systems have contention and coherency costs**

```
C(N) = N / (1 + α(N-1) + βN(N-1))

Where:
- N = Number of processors
- α = Contention penalty
- β = Coherency penalty
```

**Reality**: Systems often slow down with too many processors.

</div>

## Decision Models

### 25. The Cynefin Framework 🗺️

<div class="model-box">

**Different problems need different approaches**

```
        Complex  |  Complicated
     (Probe-Sense-|  (Sense-Analyze-
       Respond)   |    Respond)
    --------------|----------------
        Chaotic   |    Simple
     (Act-Sense-  |  (Sense-Categorize-
       Respond)   |    Respond)
```

**Application**: 
- Simple: Best practices
- Complicated: Good practices
- Complex: Emergent practices
- Chaotic: Novel practices

</div>

### 26. The OODA Loop 🔄

<div class="model-box">

**Decision-making in dynamic environments**

```
Observe → Orient → Decide → Act
   ↑                          ↓
   ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

**Faster OODA loops win**

**Application**: Incident response, system adaptation, competitive advantage.

</div>

## Reliability Models

### 27. The Error Budget 💰

<div class="model-box">

**Reliability target leaves room for innovation**

```
99.9% uptime = 43.2 minutes/month downtime allowed

Error Budget = Allowed Downtime - Actual Downtime

If budget > 0: Ship features faster
If budget < 0: Focus on reliability
```

**Key insight**: 100% reliability is too expensive and slows innovation.

</div>

### 28. The Failure Modes Hierarchy 📉

<div class="model-box">

**Not all failures are equal**

```
1. Fail-stop (best)
   → Clear failure, system stops

2. Fail-slow
   → Performance degradation

3. Fail-silent
   → Drops requests silently

4. Fail-byzantine (worst)
   → Produces wrong results
```

**Design preference**: Fail fast and obvious.

</div>
