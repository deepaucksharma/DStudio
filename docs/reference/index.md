## Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows these core principles:

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Write for understanding, not to impress
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
3. **Visual Learning**: Use diagrams and examples liberally
4. **Practical Focus**: Always connect theory to practice
5. **Inclusive Language**: Write for a global, diverse audience

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Prefer active voice
- Write in present tense
- Use second person ("you") for instructions
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences)

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify all code examples work
- Include version information where relevant
- Provide complete, runnable examples
- Test all commands and configurations

### Visual Elements
- Use Mermaid diagrams for architecture and flow
- Include screenshots for UI elements
- Provide code syntax highlighting
- Use tables for comparisons

## Content Structure

### Page Organization
1. **Title and Metadata**: Clear, descriptive title with appropriate metadata
2. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the topic
3. **Prerequisites**: What readers need to know
4. **Main Content**: Organized with clear headings

6. **Summary**: Key takeaways
7. **Related Resources**: Links to related content

### Navigation Hierarchy
- Maximum 3 levels deep
