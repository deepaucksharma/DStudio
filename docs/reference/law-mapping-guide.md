## Detailed Mapping and Evolution

### Old Law 1: Latency ‚Üí New Law 2: Asynchronous Reality

**What changed:**
- **Scope**: Expanded from just communication delays to the fundamental impossibility of knowing "now"
- **Theory**: Added FLP impossibility theorem, Lamport's happens-before, Shannon's information theory
- **Focus**: Shifted from measuring latency to reasoning about temporal uncertainty

**Key concepts added:**

- Formal temporal logic and partial ordering
- The unknowability of the present in distributed systems

### Old Law 2: Finite Capacity ‚Üí Distributed Across Multiple Laws

**What changed:**
- **Integration**: Capacity constraints now appear as aspects of other laws rather than standalone
- **Context**: Capacity limits manifest differently in different contexts

**Where to find capacity concepts:**
- **In Law 3 (Emergent Chaos)**: How capacity limits trigger phase transitions
- **In Law 4 (Trade-offs)**: Capacity as one dimension in optimization space

### Old Law 3: Failure ‚Üí New Law 1: Failure

**What changed:**

- **Theory**: Added complexity theory, phase transitions, self-organized criticality
- **Focus**: From managing concurrency to understanding emergent behaviors

**Key concepts added:**
- State space explosion at scale

### Old Law 5: Coordination ‚Üí New Law 4: Trade-offs

**What changed:**
- **Perspective**: Coordination cost is one dimension in a larger trade-off space
- **Sophistication**: Moved beyond CAP theorem to n-dimensional optimization

**Key concepts added:**
- Multi-objective optimization theory
- Non-linear trade-off surfaces

### Old Law 6: Observability ‚Üí New Law 5: Epistemology

**What changed:**
- **Philosophy**: Reframed as epistemology - what can be known
- **Theory**: Added formal knowledge logic, Byzantine epistemology
- **Depth**: Distinguishes belief, knowledge, and common knowledge

**Key concepts added:**
- Levels of distributed knowledge
- Probabilistic certainty (Bloom filters, HyperLogLog)
- The cost of certainty in distributed systems

**Find it here:** [Law of Distributed Knowledge](/part1-axioms/law5-epistemology/)

### Old Law 7: Human Interface ‚Üí New Law 6: Human-API

**What changed:**
- **Focus**: From generic human factors to specific cognitive constraints
- **Application**: Mental models, error design, incident response
- **Theory**: Added cognitive science principles, 7¬±2 rule

**Key concepts added:**
- Mental model accuracy requirements
- Cognitive load of different consistency models
- Observability as user interface design

### Old Law 7: Economics ‚Üí New Law 7: Economics

**What changed:**
- **Depth**: Enhanced with TCO, opportunity cost, build vs buy analysis
- **Integration**: Links architectural decisions directly to financial impact
- **Modern concepts**: Added FinOps, cloud economics, performance per dollar

**Key concepts added:**
- Total Cost of Ownership modeling
- Economic modeling of architectural choices
- Cost-aware system design

**Find it here:** [Law of Economic Reality](/part1-axioms/law7-economics/)

## Why the Framework Was Restructured

### 1. **From Description to Foundation**
The old framework described observable phenomena. The new framework identifies fundamental laws from which these phenomena emerge.

### 2. **From Independence to Interaction**
The old laws were presented as independent facts. The new laws explicitly acknowledge their deep interconnections.

### 3. **From Simplification to Nuance**
The old framework prioritized accessibility. The new framework embraces complexity while remaining practical.

### 4. **From Observation to Theory**
The old laws were empirical observations. The new laws are grounded in formal theory from multiple disciplines.

## Key Conceptual Differences

### Old Framework Mindset
- "Here are 8 things that make distributed systems hard"
- Each law is a separate challenge
- Focus on individual problems
- Practical patterns for each law

### New Framework Mindset
- "Here are 7 fundamental laws governing all distributed systems"
- Laws interact to create complex behaviors
- Focus on systemic understanding
- Theoretical foundations inform practice

## Migration Tips for Different Audiences

### For Engineers Using the Old Framework
1. Your understanding remains valid - the new framework builds on it
2. Start with the laws that map directly to laws you use most
3. Explore the new emergent complexity concepts in Law 3
4. Pay attention to the theoretical foundations sections

### For Educators and Trainers
1. The old framework remains excellent for introduction
2. Use the new framework for advanced courses
3. The mapping guide helps create learning progressions
4. Consider teaching both as "levels" of understanding

### For System Architects
1. The multidimensional trade-off model (Law 4) revolutionizes design decisions
2. Correlated failure analysis (Law 1) improves reliability planning
3. Economic modeling (Law 7) helps justify architectural choices
4. Cognitive load (Law 6) informs API and tool design
