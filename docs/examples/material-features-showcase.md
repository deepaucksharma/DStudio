# Material for MkDocs Features Showcase

This page demonstrates all the advanced Material for MkDocs features implemented across the documentation site.

## üé® Section-Specific Color Themes

Different sections of the documentation have unique color schemes for better visual organization:

!!! axiom "Laws Section - Deep Purple Theme"
    Pages under `/part1-axioms/` use deep purple (#5E35B1) as the primary color.
    
    - Headers adapt to section colors
    - Admonitions use matching color schemes
    - Visual consistency throughout the section

!!! pillar "Pillars Section - Teal Theme"
    Pages under `/part2-pillars/` use teal (#00897B) as the primary color.
    
    - Distinct visual identity
    - Easy section recognition
    - Consistent theming

!!! pattern "Patterns Section - Blue Theme"
    Pattern documentation uses blue (#1976D2) for clear categorization.

## üìù Code Annotations

Code blocks now support inline annotations for better explanations:

```python
def circuit_breaker(func):
    """Decorator implementing circuit breaker pattern"""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if state == "OPEN":  # (1)!
            raise CircuitOpenError("Circuit breaker is open")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)  # (2)!
            on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            on_failure()  # (3/index)!
            raise e
    
    return wrapper
```

1. When circuit is open, fail fast without calling the service
2. Execute the actual function if circuit is closed
3. Track failures to determine when to open circuit

## üîΩ Progressive Disclosure

Complex information is organized with collapsible sections:

??? info "Basic Collapsible"
    This content is hidden by default and revealed on click.
    
    - Reduces initial cognitive load
    - Users choose their depth of exploration
    - Cleaner page layout

???+ warning "Expanded by Default"
    Using `???+` makes sections expanded by default.
    
    Important information that should be visible immediately but can be collapsed if needed.

??? example "Nested Progressive Disclosure"
    Top level information here.
    
    ??? note "Nested Detail"
        More specific information nested inside.
        
        ??? tip "Deep Nesting"
            Very specific details at the third level.
