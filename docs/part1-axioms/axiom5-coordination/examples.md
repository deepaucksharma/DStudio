# Coordination Examples

## Real-World Case Studies

### The $2M Two-Phase Commit
A detailed financial analysis of how global transaction coordination can lead to massive infrastructure costs.

### Eventual Consistency Success Stories
How companies reduced coordination costs by 40x through architectural changes.

## Code Examples

### Coordination Overhead Measurement
Working code to measure the performance impact of different coordination strategies.

### Protocol Comparisons
Side-by-side implementations of 2PC, Paxos, and Raft showing complexity differences.

## Cost Optimization Strategies
