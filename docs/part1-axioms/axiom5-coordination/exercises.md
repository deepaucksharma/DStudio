# Coordination Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Measure Coordination Overhead
Use the provided Python code to quantify coordination costs in your system.

### Lab 2: Cost Calculator
Build a coordination cost calculator for different consensus protocols.

### Lab 3: Protocol Selection
Given various scenarios, choose the most cost-effective coordination protocol.

## Challenge Problems

1. Calculate the monthly AWS bill for a given coordination pattern
2. Design a system that minimizes coordination while maintaining consistency
3. Implement a simple gossip protocol and measure its convergence time

## Design Exercises

- How would you reduce the $2M/month coordination cost in the case study?
- When is Byzantine consensus worth its extreme cost?
