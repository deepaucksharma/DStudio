# Economics Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Cost Attribution
Implement cost tracking for your application's operations.

### Lab 2: FinOps Audit
Use the quick-win checklist to audit a real AWS account.

### Lab 3: Serverless vs Servers Calculator
Build a calculator to determine the break-even point.

### Lab 4: Spot Instance Design
Design a system that gracefully handles instance termination.

## Challenge Problems

1. Calculate the true cost of a distributed transaction
2. Design a multi-region architecture optimized for cost
3. Build an automated cost anomaly detection system
4. Create a cost-aware autoscaling algorithm

## Thought Experiments

- What's the economic impact of eventual consistency?
- How do you price an internal service?
- When is it cheaper to drop requests than serve them?

## Real-World Scenarios

- Your bill doubled overnight - how do you investigate?
- You have $10K/month budget - design the best possible system
- Reduce costs by 50% without impacting SLOs - where do you start?
