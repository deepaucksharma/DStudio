# Archive: Old 8-Axiom Structure

This directory contains the original 8-axiom structure that was used before the refactoring to the new 7-axiom framework.

## Old Structure (8 Axioms)

1. **Axiom 1: Latency** - The speed of light creates fundamental communication delays
2. **Axiom 2: Capacity** - All resources have finite limits
3. **Axiom 3: Failure** - Components will fail independently  
4. **Axiom 4: Concurrency** - Multiple operations happen simultaneously
5. **Axiom 5: Coordination** - Agreement requires communication
6. **Axiom 6: Observability** - Internal state cannot be directly observed
7. **Axiom 7: Human Interface** - Humans interact with systems
8. **Axiom 8: Economics** - Systems have economic constraints

## New Structure (7 Axioms)

The system has been refactored to a new 7-axiom structure:

1. **Axiom 1: Failure is Inevitable** - Components will fail independently
2. **Axiom 2: Everything is Asynchronous** - No truly synchronous operations at scale
3. **Axiom 3: Complexity Emerges** - Simple rules create complex behaviors
4. **Axiom 4: Everything is a Trade-off** - No perfect solutions, only optimal choices
5. **Axiom 5: Knowledge is Always Partial** - Complete system knowledge is impossible
6. **Axiom 6: The Human API is Fixed** - Human cognitive limits constrain design
7. **Axiom 7: Economics Governs Adoption** - Cost-benefit drives technology choices

## Purpose of This Archive

This archive is preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding the evolution of the framework
- Accessing content that may not have been fully migrated
- Comparison between old and new conceptual models

## Migration Status

The content from the old 8-axiom structure has been reorganized and enhanced in the new 7-axiom framework. The new structure better reflects the fundamental nature of distributed systems by:
- Elevating failure to the primary axiom
- Combining latency, capacity, and concurrency concepts under "Everything is Asynchronous"
- Introducing emergence as a core principle
- Making trade-offs explicit as a fundamental axiom
- Reframing observability as epistemology (partial knowledge)
- Maintaining human and economic factors as essential constraints

**Note**: This is an archive directory. All active development should use the new 7-axiom structure in the parent directory.
