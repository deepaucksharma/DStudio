# The Lens: How to See Cognitive Overload

!!! quote "Core Insight"
    **You can't fix what you can't see. Learn to spot cognitive overload before it kills your system.**

## The Magic Number: 7±2

```
MILLER'S LAW (1956)

         COGNITIVE OVERLOAD
```

## The Three Types of Load

```
INTRINSIC LOAD               EXTRANEOUS LOAD              GERMANE LOAD
══════════════               ═══════════════              ════════════
Task complexity              Poor presentation            Learning effort
(Can't reduce)               (MUST reduce)                (Good investment)

"Understand consensus"       "Find in 47 dashboards"      "Build mental model"
"Debug distributed system"   "Decode cryptic errors"      "Learn patterns"
"Trace failures"            "Navigate bad UI"             "Gain expertise"

                ↓                    ↓                          ↓
         
         Accept this          ELIMINATE THIS              Facilitate this
```

!!! danger "The Critical Equation"
    ```
    Intrinsic + Extraneous + Germane = Total Load
    
    If Total > 7±2 = SYSTEM FAILURE
    ```

## The Stress Catastrophe

```

## The Mental Model Ladder

How operators understand your system:

```
EXPERTISE LEVELS & COGNITIVE CAPACITY
════════════════════════════════════

Level 5: EXPERT (5+ years)
├─ Capacity: Full system in head
├─ Model: Deep causal chains
└─ Failure: Overconfidence kills

Level 4: PROFICIENT (2-5 years)  
├─ Capacity: Multiple subsystems
├─ Model: Intuitive patterns
└─ Failure: Novel situations

Level 3: COMPETENT (1-2 years)
├─ Capacity: Single subsystem
├─ Model: Cause → Effect
└─ Failure: Cascade effects

Level 2: BEGINNER (6-12 months)
├─ Capacity: Direct dependencies  
├─ Model: If this then that
└─ Failure: Side effects

Level 1: NOVICE (0-6 months)
├─ Capacity: Single service
├─ Model: Memorized procedures
└─ Failure: Any deviation
```

!!! warning "Design for Level 1 under stress"
    Your expert becomes a novice at 3 AM during an outage.

## The Information Processing Funnel

```
SENSORY INPUT                    WORKING MEMORY              LONG-TERM MEMORY
═════════════                    ══════════════              ════════════════
Unlimited capacity      ──→      7±2 items          ──→      Unlimited storage
< 1 second                       ~18 seconds                  Permanent (if encoded)

Your dashboards:                 What operators see:          What they remember:
1000s of metrics       ──→      Maybe 5-7 items      ──→      Patterns & shortcuts

        Most information lost here ──┘

## The Cognitive Load Detector

### Signs of Overload in Your System:

```
BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS                    SYSTEM SYMPTOMS
═══════════════════                   ═══════════════
□ Operators freeze during incidents    □ Same failures repeat
□ Wrong buttons pushed repeatedly      □ Recovery takes hours not minutes
□ Can't explain what went wrong        □ Runbooks ignored under pressure
□ Rely on one "hero" who knows all    □ Changes cause unexpected breaks
□ New hires take months to be useful   □ Automation makes things worse

If you check > 3 boxes, you have a cognitive load problem
```

## The Comprehension Pyramid

```
What operators need to understand:

         ╱╲
        ╱  ╲        Level 3: WHY 
       ╱ WHY ╲       "Why did it fail?"
      ╱______╲      (Root cause)
     ╱        ╲
    ╱   WHAT   ╲    Level 2: WHAT
   ╱____________╲   "What is broken?"
  ╱              ╲  (Current state)
 ╱    WHERE/WHEN  ╲ Level 1: WHERE/WHEN
╱__________________╲"Where is the problem?"
                    (Basic location)

Most systems bury operators in Level 1 data
Great systems elevate them to Level 3 insights
```

## The Context Switch Tax

```
Every switch costs 23 minutes of deep focus:

Timeline of an incident:
═══════════════════════
00:00 Alert fires            ◆ Context 1: Slack
00:01 Check dashboard       ◆ Context 2: Grafana  
00:03 SSH to server         ◆ Context 3: Terminal
00:05 Check logs            ◆ Context 4: Kibana
00:07 Read runbook          ◆ Context 5: Wiki
00:09 Run queries           ◆ Context 6: Database
00:11 Update ticket         ◆ Context 7: Jira

Switches: 7
Cognitive cost: 7 × 23 = 161 minutes
But incident lasted: 11 minutes

Result: Operator still confused 2.5 hours later
```

## The Cognitive Budget

You have 7±2 units. Spend them wisely:

```
POOR ALLOCATION                 SMART ALLOCATION
═══════════════                 ════════════════
-2 Finding the right dashboard  -1 Single pane of glass
-3 Parsing cryptic errors       -1 Clear error messages
-2 Remembering procedures       -1 Guided runbooks
-2 Context switching            -1 Integrated tools
-1 Understanding state          -3 Solving actual problem
══                              ══
10 units (overload!)            7 units (manageable)
```

## Applying the Lens

### Quick Assessment Questions:

1. **The Dashboard Test**: Can you explain your system health in 7 items or less?
2. **The New Hire Test**: Can someone productive in days, not months?
3. **The 3 AM Test**: Can a tired operator diagnose issues in < 5 minutes?
4. **The Mental Model Test**: Can operators predict cascade effects?
5. **The Stress Test**: Does performance degrade gracefully under pressure?

### What You'll See:

When you apply this lens, you'll notice:

- **Invisible complexity** that experts have learned to ignore
- **Information scattered** across too many tools
- **Critical signals buried** in noise
- **Procedures that assume** perfect conditions
- **Automation that hides** rather than helps

!!! success "The Goal"
    ```
    See your system through novice eyes under stress.
    That's your true cognitive load.

!!! tip "Remember"
    Cognitive capacity isn't a nice-to-have. It's a hard limit. Exceed it, and your humans fail. When your humans fail, your systems fail. Design accordingly.
