## The Three Types of Load

INTRINSIC LOAD               EXTRANEOUS LOAD              GERMANE LOAD
══════════════               ═══════════════              ════════════
Task complexity              Poor presentation            Learning effort

"Understand consensus"       "Find in 47 dashboards"      "Build mental model"
"Debug distributed system"   "Decode cryptic errors"      "Learn patterns"
"Trace failures"            "Navigate bad UI"             "Gain expertise"

                ↓                    ↓                          ↓

    ```

    If Total > 7±2 = SYSTEM FAILURE

## The Mental Model Ladder

How operators understand your system:

```
EXPERTISE LEVELS & COGNITIVE CAPACITY
════════════════════════════════════

Level 5: EXPERT (5+ years)
├─ Capacity: Full system in head
├─ Model: Deep causal chains
└─ Failure: Overconfidence kills

Level 4: PROFICIENT (2-5 years)  
├─ Capacity: Multiple subsystems
├─ Model: Intuitive patterns
└─ Failure: Novel situations

Level 3: COMPETENT (1-2 years)
├─ Capacity: Single subsystem
├─ Model: Cause → Effect
└─ Failure: Cascade effects

Level 2: BEGINNER (6-12 months)
├─ Capacity: Direct dependencies  
├─ Model: If this then that
└─ Failure: Side effects

Level 1: NOVICE (0-6 months)
├─ Capacity: Single service
├─ Model: Memorized procedures
└─ Failure: Any deviation
```

## The Cognitive Load Detector

### Signs of Overload in Your System:

```
BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS                    SYSTEM SYMPTOMS
═══════════════════                   ═══════════════
□ Operators freeze during incidents    □ Same failures repeat
□ Wrong buttons pushed repeatedly      □ Recovery takes hours not minutes
□ Can't explain what went wrong        □ Runbooks ignored under pressure
□ Rely on one "hero" who knows all    □ Changes cause unexpected breaks
□ New hires take months to be useful   □ Automation makes things worse

If you check > 3 boxes, you have a cognitive load problem
```

## The Comprehension Pyramid

```
What operators need to understand:

         ╱╲
        ╱  ╲        Level 3: WHY 
       ╱ WHY ╲       "Why did it fail?"
      ╱______╲      (Root cause)
     ╱        ╲
    ╱   WHAT   ╲    Level 2: WHAT
   ╱____________╲   "What is broken?"
  ╱              ╲  (Current state)
 ╱    WHERE/WHEN  ╲ Level 1: WHERE/WHEN
╱__________________╲"Where is the problem?"
                    (Basic location)

Most systems bury operators in Level 1 data
Great systems elevate them to Level 3 insights
```

## The Context Switch Tax

```
Every switch costs 23 minutes of deep focus:

Timeline of an incident:
═══════════════════════
00:00 Alert fires            ◆ Context 1: Slack
00:01 Check dashboard       ◆ Context 2: Grafana  
00:03 SSH to server         ◆ Context 3: Terminal
00:05 Check logs            ◆ Context 4: Kibana
00:07 Read runbook          ◆ Context 5: Wiki
00:09 Run queries           ◆ Context 6: Database
00:11 Update ticket         ◆ Context 7: Jira

Switches: 7
Cognitive cost: 7 × 23 = 161 minutes
But incident lasted: 11 minutes

Result: Operator still confused 2.5 hours later
```

## The Cognitive Budget

You have 7±2 units. Spend them wisely:

```
POOR ALLOCATION                 SMART ALLOCATION
═══════════════                 ════════════════
-2 Finding the right dashboard  -1 Single pane of glass
-3 Parsing cryptic errors       -1 Clear error messages
-2 Remembering procedures       -1 Guided runbooks
-2 Context switching            -1 Integrated tools
-1 Understanding state          -3 Solving actual problem
══                              ══
10 units (overload!)            7 units (manageable)
```

## Applying the Lens

### Quick Assessment Questions:

1. **The Dashboard Test**: Can you explain your system health in 7 items or less?
2. **The New Hire Test**: Can someone productive in days, not months?
3. **The 3 AM Test**: Can a tired operator diagnose issues in < 5 minutes?
4. **The Mental Model Test**: Can operators predict cascade effects?
5. **The Stress Test**: Does performance degrade gracefully under pressure?

### What You'll See:

When you apply this lens, you'll notice:

- **Invisible complexity** that experts have learned to ignore
- **Information scattered** across too many tools
- **Critical signals buried** in noise
- **Procedures that assume** perfect conditions
- **Automation that hides** rather than helps

!!! success "The Goal"

    See your system through novice eyes under stress.
    That's your true cognitive load.

!!! tip "Remember"
    Cognitive capacity isn't a nice-to-have. It's a hard limit. Exceed it, and your humans fail. When your humans fail, your systems fail. Design accordingly.
