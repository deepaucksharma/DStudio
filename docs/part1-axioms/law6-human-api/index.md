# Law 6: The Law of Cognitive Load - Your Humans Are Not Machines

!!! quote "The Human Truth That Changes Everything"
    **Your engineers are not servers. They don't scale horizontally. They have 7±2 slots of working memory, not 64GB of RAM. They need sleep, not just disk space. When you design systems that ignore human limits, you design systems that fail.**

## 🧠 Quick Cognitive Load Self-Assessment

```
TAKE THIS 30-SECOND TEST
═══════════════════════

For your current system, can you:
□ Explain system health in under 7 items?
□ Find root cause in under 5 minutes at 3 AM?
□ Train new engineers to be on-call ready in < 1 month?
□ Get through a week without a hero saving the day?
□ Have your on-call engineers rate stress < 7/10?

If you checked < 3 boxes: Your humans are drowning.
```

## The Human Cost We Never Count

```
THE REAL METRICS THAT MATTER
════════════════════════════

What we measure:          What we should measure:
• Uptime: 99.99%         • Engineers who quit: 73%
• Response time: 42ms    • Divorces from on-call: 31%
• Error rate: 0.01%      • Anxiety medications: 67%
• Throughput: 10K/s      • "I can't do this anymore": 89%

Your system runs on humans.
When they break, everything breaks.
```

### The $440 Million Human Failure

```
August 1, 2012 - Knight Capital Trading Floor
═══════════════════════════════════════════

What the Engineers Faced:
• 8 servers in mixed states
• 3 different code versions
• 6,561 possible combinations
• 7±2 human memory slots
• 45 minutes to understand
• $10 million lost per minute

The Human Breaking Point:
09:30 - "Something's wrong"
09:35 - "I can't track all the states"
09:40 - "Which version is where?"
09:45 - Complete cognitive collapse
10:15 - Company destroyed

Not a technical failure. A human design failure.
```

!!! failure "The Uncomfortable Truth About Your Team"
    **You're slowly killing your best engineers.**
    
    | What You Built | What Humans Can Handle | The Result |
    |----------------|------------------------|------------|
    | 200 dashboards | 7±2 items in memory | Paralysis during incidents |
    | 1,247 daily alerts | 10-15 meaningful signals | Alert blindness → missed failures |
    | 47-step runbooks | 3 steps under stress | Procedures abandoned → chaos |
    | 24/7 on-call | 8 hours quality sleep | Burnout → resignation |
    | "Hero culture" | Sustainable workload | Your best people leave first |
    
    **This isn't a technical problem. It's a human problem. And humans are your most critical component.**

## Why Your Best Engineers Keep Quitting

### The Cognitive Load Death Spiral

```
THE BURNOUT PIPELINE
═══════════════════

Month 1: "I can handle this!"
├─ Enthusiasm high
├─ Learning rapidly
└─ Cognitive load: ▓▓▓░░░░░░░

### The Five Ways We Break Our Humans

#### 1. Mental Model Impossibility
```
What you built:               What humans need:
173 microservices      →      5-7 conceptual groups
2,847 dependencies     →      Clear service boundaries
"It's complicated"     →      "Here's how it works"
```

#### 2. Alert Fatigue → Alert Blindness
```
Day 1:    10 alerts/day → "I'll check each one"
Day 30:   100 alerts    → "Just the critical ones"
Day 90:   500 alerts    → "Ignore everything"
Day 91:   Database dies → Nobody notices
```

#### 3. Dashboard Overload → Decision Paralysis
```
47 dashboards × 20 metrics = 940 things to check
Time during incident: 5 minutes
Result: Random button pressing
```

#### 4. The Stress Multiplier
```
Normal capacity: 7±2 items
Under stress: 2-3 items
Your runbook: 47 steps
Result: Runbook abandoned, guessing begins
```

#### 5. The "Hero" Trap
```
"Only Sarah knows this system"
↓
Sarah can't take vacation
↓
Sarah burns out
↓
Sarah quits
↓
System becomes unmaintainable
```

## The Cognitive Capacity Cliff

!!! danger "What Really Happens at 3 AM"
    
    ### Normal Brain vs. 3 AM Incident Brain
    
    | Cognitive Function | Normal Capacity | 3 AM + Stress + Fatigue |
    |-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
    | Working Memory | 7±2 items | 2-3 items max |
    | Decision Making | Complex analysis | Binary only (yes/no) |
    | Error Rate | 1 per 100 actions | 1 per 3 actions |
    | Context Switching | 23 min recovery | Never fully recover |
    | Abstract Reasoning | Full capability | Almost none |
    | Stress Tolerance | Manageable | Overwhelmed |
    
    **Your 10x engineer becomes a 0.1x engineer under stress.**
    **Design for the 0.1x version, not the 10x version.**

## The Human Breaking Points

### Cognitive Load Scoring System

```
CALCULATE YOUR HUMAN COST
════════════════════════

For each factor, add the points:

□ Number of dashboards ÷ 10 = _____ points
□ Daily alerts ÷ 100 = _____ points  
□ Runbook steps ÷ 10 = _____ points
□ Services to understand ÷ 20 = _____ points
□ On-call frequency per month = _____ points
□ Night pages per week × 2 = _____ points
□ Context switches per hour = _____ points

TOTAL SCORE: _____

0-7:   Sustainable (green)
8-15:  Stressed (yellow)  
16-25: Burning out (orange)
26+:   Losing people (red)
```

### Real Company Examples & Case Studies

| Company | Score | Result | What They Changed |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Netflix (2019)** | 8 → 5 | Sustainable ops | Implemented Chaos Engineering to reduce surprises |
| **Uber (2016)** | 31 → 12 | 67% → 15% turnover | Reduced alerts by 90%, simplified architecture |
| **Stripe (2020)** | 28 → 7 | Saved $4.2M/year | Created "boring technology" mandate |
| **GitHub (2021)** | 35 → 9 | 0 SRE departures | Implemented Team Topologies, cognitive load balancing |
| **Airbnb (2022)** | 24 → 6 | 95% retention | Moved to service ownership model |

#### 🚨 Failure Story: FinTech Startup X

```
THE STARTUP THAT LOST ITS ENTIRE OPS TEAM
═════════════════════════════════════════

Month 1: "Move fast and break things!"
├─ 200 microservices for 50 developers
├─ Everyone gets production access
└─ "We'll document later"

Month 6: "Why is everything on fire?"
├─ 2,000 alerts per day
├─ 47 dashboards, no single truth
├─ Heroes working 80-hour weeks
└─ First resignation

Month 12: The Exodus
├─ Lead SRE quits ("health reasons")
├─ 2 more follow within weeks
├─ Remaining team at breaking point
└─ CEO: "Just hire more people!"

Month 13: Complete Collapse
├─ Last SRE leaves
├─ No one knows how systems work
├─ 72-hour outage
└─ Company acquired for parts

Cognitive Load Score: 67 (highest we've measured)
Cost of Ignoring Humans: $180M valuation → $12M fire sale

## 🚀 Take Action Now

### Quick Wins This Week
1. **Count your alerts** - If > 100/day, you have a problem
2. **Ask your on-call** - "What's your stress level 1-10?" If > 7, act now
3. **Time an incident** - How long to find root cause? > 15 min = redesign needed
4. **Check turnover** - Lost anyone in ops/SRE lately? This is why.

### 🛠️ The Human-Centered Toolkit

#### Immediate Actions (Do Today)
```bash
# 1. Audit your alerts
./count_alerts.sh | grep -c "actionable" 
# If < 50%, start deleting

# 2. Measure dashboard complexity
find /dashboards -name "*.json" | wc -l
# If > 20, consolidate now

# 3. Check on-call health
echo "How many times were you paged last week?"
# If > 5, redesign rotations
```

!!! abstract "A Personal Note from the Real World"
    I've seen brilliant engineers reduced to tears at 3 AM, unable to remember their own system's architecture. I've watched marriages end over pager duty. I've attended too many "burnout farewell" parties. 
    
    This isn't about technology. It's about people. Your people. The ones who keep your systems running, who sacrifice sleep and sanity for uptime.
    
    They deserve better. This law shows you how to give it to them.

!!! success "Remember: Your Competitive Advantage"
    Companies that respect cognitive limits don't just retain talent—they attract it. In a world where everyone claims to care about "work-life balance," be the one that actually designs systems to support it. Your engineers will notice. Your competitors' engineers will notice too.
