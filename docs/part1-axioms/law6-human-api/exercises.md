# Law 6 Exercises: Cognitive Load

## Exercise 1: Measure Your Team's Cognitive Load

Use the scoring framework from the main content to assess your team:

1. **Operational Clarity** (0-25 points)
2. **Stress Resilience** (0-25 points)  
3. **Team Sustainability** (0-25 points)
4. **Cognitive Design** (0-25 points)

Document specific examples for each score.

## Exercise 2: Alert Fatigue Analysis

Analyze your team's last week of alerts:

1. Total alerts received
2. Actionable vs non-actionable ratio
3. Time distribution (business hours vs after hours)
4. Alert response time patterns
5. False positive rate

Create an action plan to reduce alert fatigue by 50%.

## Exercise 3: Runbook Simplification

Take your most complex runbook and:

1. Count the number of decision points
2. Measure time to complete under stress
3. Identify cognitive bottlenecks
4. Redesign to fit the 7Â±2 rule
5. Test with a team member who hasn't seen it

## Exercise 4: On-Call Load Balancing

Design an on-call rotation that respects cognitive limits:

1. Maximum shifts per person per month
2. Recovery time between incidents
3. Handoff procedures that preserve context
4. Documentation accessibility under stress
5. Escalation paths that minimize decision fatigue

## Exercise 5: Dashboard Redesign

Redesign your main ops dashboard following cognitive principles:

1. Maximum 7 key metrics visible
2. Progressive disclosure for details
3. Color coding that works under stress
4. Clear visual hierarchy
5. One-glance incident detection

Test the new design during a simulated incident.

## Discussion Questions

1. How does cognitive load multiply during cascading failures?
2. What's the relationship between system complexity and human error rate?
3. How can automation reduce cognitive load without creating new complexity?
4. What are the signs of cognitive overload in your team?
5. How do you balance thoroughness with cognitive capacity in documentation?

## Capstone Project: Cognitive Load Budget

Create a "cognitive load budget" for your team:

1. Assess current load across all systems
2. Identify the top 3 cognitive drains
3. Propose architectural changes to reduce load
4. Calculate the ROI of cognitive improvements
5. Present to leadership with metrics

Success metric: Reduce on-call stress scores by 40% in 3 months.
