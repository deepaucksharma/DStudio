# Axiom 7: Human-System Interface

---

## Level 1: Intuition (Start Here) ðŸŒ±

### The Airline Cockpit Metaphor

Think about airplane cockpits:
- **1920s**: Hundreds of unlabeled switches, dials everywhere
- **1970s**: Organized panels, standard layouts
- **Today**: Glass cockpits, automation, clear alerts

**Your ops interface is a cockpit.** Bad design causes:
- Wrong button pressed â†’ System down
- Information overload â†’ Missed problems
- Poor layout â†’ Slow response
- No automation â†’ Human exhaustion

### Real-World Analogy: Kitchen Design

```text
Bad Kitchen (Bad Ops Interface):
- Knives mixed with spoons
- Hot stove next to paper towels
- No labels on spice jars
- Fire extinguisher behind locked door
Result: Chaos, burns, mistakes

Good Kitchen (Good Ops Interface):
- Dangerous items clearly marked
- Logical groupings
- Safety equipment accessible
- Clear workflows
Result: Efficient, safe cooking
```

### Your First Human Factors Experiment

### The Human Limitations Chart

| Human Aspect | Limitation | System Design Implication |
|--------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Reading Speed** | 200-300 words/min | Don't flood with text |
| **Reaction Time** | 200ms minimum | Don't require split-second decisions |
| **Short-term Memory** | 7Â±2 items | Group related things |
| **Attention Span** | 20 minutes focused | Automate routine tasks |
| **Error Rate** | 1% normally, 10% under stress | Add confirmations |
| **Work Hours** | 8 hours/day | Build for handoffs |

## Level 2: Foundation (Understand Why) ðŸŒ¿

### Core Principle: Humans ARE the System

### The Swiss Cheese Model

### ðŸŽ¬ Failure Vignette: Amazon S3 Outage 2017

### Cognitive Load Theory

---

## Level 3: Deep Dive (Master the Patterns) ðŸŒ³

### Information Architecture Patterns

### Confirmation Patterns

### Automation Decision Matrix

### The Perfect Runbook Template

---

## Level 4: Expert (Production Patterns) ðŸŒ²

### Case Study: NASA Mission Control Design

### Advanced UI Patterns

### Toil Measurement and Elimination

---

## Level 5: Mastery (Push the Boundaries) ðŸŒ´

### The Future: Augmented Operations

### The Human-Centric Design Principles

## Summary: Key Insights by Level

### ðŸŒ± Beginner
1. **Humans have limits - design for them**
2. **Bad UI causes disasters**
3. **Meaningful names prevent errors**

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
1. **Humans ARE part of the system**
2. **Swiss cheese model - layer defenses**
3. **Cognitive load management critical**

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
1. **Progressive disclosure manages complexity**
2. **Confirmation proportional to impact**
3. **Runbooks that actually work**

### ðŸŒ² Expert
1. **NASA principles apply to ops**
2. **Toil measurement drives automation**
3. **Context prevents confusion**

### ðŸŒ´ Master
1. **Future is augmented, not replaced**
2. **AI as partner, not overlord**
3. **Design for human+machine symbiosis**
