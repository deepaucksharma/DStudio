# Human Interface Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Design a Safe CLI
Build a command-line interface that prevents common operator errors.

### Lab 2: Runbook Template
Create a runbook for a common failure scenario in your system.

### Lab 3: Toil Analysis
Calculate the toil index for your team's operations.

### Lab 4: Progressive Disclosure
Design a UI that works for both novices and experts.

## Challenge Problems

1. Design a system status page for different audiences (SRE, manager, executive)
2. Create an automation priority matrix based on toil scores
3. Build a "chaos monkey" that's safe for humans to use
4. Design confirmation UX for operations of varying risk levels

## Thought Experiments

- How would you design a system UI for color-blind operators?
- What's the optimal on-call rotation considering human factors?
- How do you balance automation with operator skill retention?
