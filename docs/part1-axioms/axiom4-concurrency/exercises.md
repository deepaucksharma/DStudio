# Concurrency Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Race Condition Detection
Use the provided Python example to demonstrate and fix race conditions.

### Lab 2: Implement Locking Strategies
Compare pessimistic vs optimistic locking performance under different contention levels.

### Lab 3: Vector Clock Implementation
Build a simple vector clock system to track causality.

## Challenge Problems

1. Design a non-blocking concurrent counter
2. Implement a deadlock-free resource allocation algorithm
3. Build a simple MVCC system

## Thought Experiments

- How would you handle the airplane seat booking problem without locks?
- What happens when network partitions occur during distributed locking?
