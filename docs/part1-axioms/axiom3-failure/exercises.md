# Partial Failure Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Chaos Engineering
Practice simulating partial failures using the provided chaos experiment commands.

### Lab 2: Build a Circuit Breaker
Implement a basic circuit breaker with configurable thresholds.

### Lab 3: Timeout Coordination
Design a timeout hierarchy for a multi-tier application.

## Challenge Problems

1. Calculate the system availability given different failure patterns
2. Design a retry strategy that prevents retry storms
3. Implement failure detection using health checks
