!!! quote "Your First Reflex From Now On"
    Where is the **control plane** or other unseen spine that will fell every component at once?

## Central Dogma of Reliability – Math vs Reality

### The Seductive Math Lie

```
P(system fails) = Π P(component_i fails)

0.001³ = 1×10⁻⁹   →   "Nine nines!"
```

### The Actual Math

```
P(system fails) = P(independent) + P(shared_dependency_j fails)

=> Availability ≈ min(component_availability) × (1 – max ρ_correlations)
```

| Variable | Meaning | Typical Range |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| *A_i* | Availability of component *i* | 95% – 99.999% |
| *ρ* | Correlation coefficient between any two components | 0.1 – 0.95 |

!!! warning "Rule of Thumb"
    If *ρ* > 0.6 anywhere, your *effective* availability collapses to within striking distance of your worst single component.

## Categories of Invisible Dependency

*Know them; draw them.*

| Glyph | Dependency Class | Typical "Gotcha" Example |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 🔌 | **Power** (feed, UPS, PDU, cooling) | Both "A+B" feeds share the same upstream breaker |
| 🌐 | **Network / Control Plane** | Auth, config, or DNS service every call path secretly hits |
| 💾 | **Data** (storage, lock, queue) | Global metadata DB behind "independent" shards |
| 🛠 | **Software / Config** | Kubernetes admission webhook, feature flag service |
| 👤 | **Human** | One on-call owning the only production credential |
| 🕰 | **Time** | Cert expiry, DST switch, leap second, cron storm |

!!! tip "Checklist Mantra"
    **P N D S H T** (Power-Network-Data-Software-Human-Time) – run it against every architecture diagram.

## Correlation Shapes – Spot Them Visually

| Shape | ASCII Sketch | Where It Hides | Why It's Deadly |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Fan-In** | `A,B,C → X` | Central key-value store, CI/CD controller | X dies ⇒ whole fleet blind |
| **Fan-Out** | `X → A,B,C` | Mis-scoped config push, regex rule | X mistake cascades in seconds |
| **Temporal Sync** | `00:00Z → All AZs deploy` | Certificate renewal, global cron job | Simultaneous blast |
| **Admin Path** | `Fix tool → Uses broken net` | Status page in same region | Blocks self-recovery |
| **Retry Feedback** | `Fail → Retry ×3 → Fail+` | Client libs with naive retry | Metastable overload |

Stare at your dependency graph until these ghosts pop out.

## Mind-Shift Table – Engineer → System Thinker

| Old Reflex | New Reflex | Mental Image |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Prevent failure** | **Make failure irrelevant** | *Bulkheads on a submarine* |
| RCA = "why did X break?" | **RCA = "why did X drag Y & Z down?"** | *Domino chain* |
| Add redundancy | **Add independence / diversity** | *Different clouds, code, teams* |
| Uptime % | **Blast-radius %** | *"How many users cry?"* |

## Dashboard Signature-Reading Cheat-Sheet

```
PATTERN 1 – Perfectly Synchronized Error Spike
  Services A-Z error lines snap upward at same timestamp
  ⇒ Likely common-cause (bad deploy / cert / control plane)

PATTERN 2 – p99 Latency ↑ 10× while HC stays flat
  ⇒ Gray failure; customers hurt, monitoring blind.

PATTERN 3 – Queue Depth Exponential Growth
  ⇒ Metastable feedback; auto-scaling won't save you.
```

!!! tip "Training Drill"
    Pick a past incident; replay graphs; ask "Which pattern?" until muscle memory forms.

## The Litmus-Test Questions

*Tape beside every whiteboard:*

1. **Pull-the-Plug Test:**
   > "If I switch off rack *R*, what *outside* that rack feels pain?"

2. **Midnight Test:**
   > "What's the worst thing that can kick off simultaneously on *all* nodes at 00:00?"

3. **Health-Check False-Positive Test:**
   > "Name one bug where `/healthz` stays green but the CEO's login fails."

4. **Blast-Radius Box Test:**
   > "Draw the rectangle around a failure domain; prove < X% users inside."

5. **Who-Can-Fix-It Test:**
   > "Can the people & tools that heal outage *F* operate while *F* is still happening?"

## The Operator's Oath

*Pin to your pager:*

```
I will no longer see servers; I will see dependency webs.
I will distrust nines that ignore correlation.
I will treat every shared resource as a latent single point of failure.
I will invest first in isolation, second in redundancy.
My mission is not perfect uptime; it is making failure inconsequential.
```

## Real-World Case Studies

| Incident | Year | Pattern | Correlation Type | Lesson |
|----------|------|---------|------------------|--------|
| **AWS EBS Storm** | 2011 | Fan-In | Control plane | All zones shared EBS control → 4-day outage |
| **S3 Typo** | 2017 | Fan-Out | Human + Tool | Status page used S3 → couldn't report S3 down |
| **GitHub Split-Brain** | 2018 | Admin Path | Network partition | Replication for HA undermined HA |
| **Cloudflare Regex** | 2019 | Temporal Sync | Global deploy | 1 regex → 100% CPU everywhere in 30s |
| **Facebook BGP** | 2021 | Admin Path | Network dependency | Tools to fix network needed network |
| **Knight Capital** | 2012 | Software version | Incomplete deploy | Old code + new flag = $440M loss |

## Strategies for Breaking Correlations

### Cell-Based Architecture
```
Traditional: 10,000 servers → 1 failure affects all
Cell-based: 100 cells × 100 servers → 1 failure affects 1%
```

### Shuffle Sharding
```
Client A → Servers [3, 17, 42, 67, 91]
Client B → Servers [8, 23, 55, 71, 94]
Overlap: < 2% vs 100% in traditional model
```

### Progressive Deployment
- **Canary**: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100%
- **Time Gap**: Wait 2^n minutes between waves
- **Auto-Rollback**: Error rate > baseline + 3σ

### Diversity Requirements
```yaml
placement_constraints:
  max_per_rack: 30%
  max_per_az: 40%
  max_per_region: 60%
  require_different: [power_domain, network_spine]
```



## The Five Specters of Failure

Every correlated failure manifests as one of five patterns:

1. **BLAST RADIUS** – Size of the crater
2. **CASCADE** – Pebble → Avalanche  
3. **GRAY FAILURE** – Looks fine, isn't
4. **METASTABLE** – Self-feeding spiral
5. **COMMON CAUSE** – One string, many puppets

    **[Master the Five Specters →](five-specters.md)** Learn to instantly recognize which pattern is killing your system.

## Key Takeaways

!!! abstract "The Core Truth"
    **Your real system availability = `min(component_availability)` × `(1 - max(correlation_coefficient))`**

### What Changed Your Mind?
1. **Illusion shattered**: Components aren't independent
2. **New lens**: See webs, not parts
3. **New mission**: Make failure inconsequential, not impossible

### Your Next Actions
1. **Today**: Run the 5 litmus tests on your current system
2. **This week**: Map all PNDSHT dependencies
3. **This month**: Implement one correlation breaker
4. **This quarter**: Measure actual ρ values in production

## Reading Road-Map

*If you crave proof:*

1. **"The Network is Reliable"** – Kingsbury & Bailis (debunks independence)
2. **"Metastable Failures"** – Bronson et al. (positive feedback death)
3. AWS & GitHub post-mortems – real graphs that match patterns above
