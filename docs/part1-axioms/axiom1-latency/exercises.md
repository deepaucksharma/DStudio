# Latency Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Measure Your Physics Tax
Use ping and traceroute to understand real-world latency.

### Lab 2: Build a Latency Budget
Create a latency budget for a sample application.

### Lab 3: Cache vs Replica Decision
Practice using the decision framework for different scenarios.

## Challenge Problems

1. Calculate the minimum theoretical latency between any two cities
2. Design a geo-distributed system with <100ms global latency
3. Implement latency-aware load balancing

## Thought Experiments

- How would you design a Mars-Earth communication protocol?
- What's the impact of satellite internet on distributed systems?
