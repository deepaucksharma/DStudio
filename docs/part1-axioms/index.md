# The 7 Fundamental Laws

[Home](/) > [The 7 Laws](/part1-axioms/) > Overview

!!! abstract "From Physics to Distributed Systems"
    These seven laws are not design choices or best practicesâ€”they are fundamental constraints derived from physics and mathematics. Every distributed system, regardless of implementation, must obey these laws.

## :material-lightbulb: Why Laws Matter

Unlike patterns that can be chosen or ignored, these laws are **inescapable truths**:

- **Derived from physics**: Speed of light, thermodynamics, information theory
- **Mathematically proven**: Not opinions or observations
- **Universal application**: Apply to all distributed systems
- **Design constraints**: Shape what's possible and impossible

- :material-numeric-1-circle:{ .lg .middle } **[Law 1: Correlated Failure](/part1-axioms/law1-failure/)**
    
    ---
    
    **Any component can fail, and failures are often correlated, not independent.**
    
    The myth of independent failure and why redundancy isn't enough.

- :material-numeric-2-circle:{ .lg .middle } **[Law 2: Asynchronous Reality](/part1-axioms/law2-asynchrony/)**
    
    ---
    
    **The network is asynchronous; there's no reliable way to distinguish slow from dead.**
    
    Why timeouts are guesses and synchronous assumptions break.

- :material-numeric-3-circle:{ .lg .middle } **[Law 3: Emergent Chaos](/part1-axioms/law3-emergence/)**
    
    ---
    
    **System behavior emerges from component interactions and cannot be predicted from individual parts.**
    
    Why distributed systems surprise us and testing isn't enough.

- :material-numeric-4-circle:{ .lg .middle } **[Law 4: Multidimensional Optimization](/part1-axioms/law4-tradeoffs/)**
    
    ---
    
    **You cannot optimize all dimensions simultaneously; trade-offs are mandatory.**
    
    The CAP theorem is just one example of fundamental trade-offs.

- :material-numeric-5-circle:{ .lg .middle } **[Law 5: Distributed Knowledge](/part1-axioms/law5-epistemology/)**
    
    ---
    
    **No single node can have perfect knowledge of the global system state.**
    
    Why consensus is hard and eventual consistency is often inevitable.

- :material-numeric-6-circle:{ .lg .middle } **[Law 6: Cognitive Load](/part1-axioms/law6-human-api/)**
    
    ---
    
    **Human cognitive capacity is the ultimate bottleneck in system complexity.**
    
    Why simple systems win and complexity compounds failures.

- :material-numeric-7-circle:{ .lg .middle } **[Law 7: Economic Reality](/part1-axioms/law7-economics/)**
    
    ---
    
    **Every technical decision has economic implications that compound over time.**
    
    Why the best technical solution may not be the right solution.

## :material-school: Learning Path

!!! tip "Recommended Study Order"
    
    While the laws are numbered, they're deeply interconnected. Here's the recommended learning path:
    
    1. **Start with Law 1** (Correlated Failure) - Understand why systems fail
    2. **Then Law 2** (Asynchronous Reality) - Learn about fundamental uncertainty
    3. **Study Law 4** (Trade-offs) - Grasp why perfect systems don't exist
    4. **Explore Law 5** (Distributed Knowledge) - See why coordination is hard
    5. **Examine Law 3** (Emergent Chaos) - Understand system complexity
    6. **Consider Law 6** (Cognitive Load) - Appreciate human limitations
    7. **Finish with Law 7** (Economic Reality) - Connect technical to business

## :material-connection: How Laws Connect to Patterns

Each law drives the need for specific patterns:

| Law | Key Patterns | Why |
|-----|-------------|-----|
| **Law 1: Correlated Failure** | Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead | Prevent cascade failures |
| **Law 2: Asynchronous Reality** | Timeout, Async Messaging | Handle uncertainty |
| **Law 3: Emergent Chaos** | Chaos Engineering, Observability | Manage complexity |
| **Law 4: Trade-offs** | CQRS, Event Sourcing | Optimize different dimensions |
| **Law 5: Distributed Knowledge** | Consensus, Eventually Consistent | Coordinate without global state |
| **Law 6: Cognitive Load** | API Gateway, Service Mesh | Abstract complexity |
| **Law 7: Economic Reality** | Auto-scaling, Serverless | Optimize costs |

## :material-test-tube: Test Your Understanding

After studying all 7 laws:

!!! question "Self-Assessment Questions"
    
    1. Why can't we just add more redundancy to solve availability?
    2. How does the speed of light create fundamental distributed systems challenges?
    3. Why is "exactly once" delivery impossible in distributed systems?
    4. What makes distributed systems inherently more complex than single-node systems?
    5. How do economic constraints shape technical architecture?

Take the comprehensive [Laws Quiz](/part1-axioms/quiz/) to test your understanding.

## :material-lightbulb: Key Insight

!!! quote "Remember"
    "In distributed systems, the question is not whether failures will happen, but how your system will behave when they do. These laws help us reason about that behavior."
