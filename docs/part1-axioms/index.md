# Part I: The Eight Fundamental Axioms

## First Principles Foundation

> "All distributed systems behavior emerges from physical and mathematical constraints"

Before we discuss any patterns, algorithms, or architectures, we must understand the fundamental constraints that govern all distributed systems. These eight axioms are not design choices—they are **inescapable realities** derived from physics, mathematics, and human nature.

## The Eight Axioms

{{ card(type='axiom', title='Axiom 1: Latency', content='Information cannot travel faster than light. This creates fundamental delays in all distributed communication.', link='axiom1-latency/index.md') }}

## Why Axioms Matter

Traditional education teaches distributed systems as a collection of solutions:
- "Use Raft for consensus"
- "Use consistent hashing for sharding"
- "Use vector clocks for ordering"

But **when do you use each?** Without understanding the underlying constraints, you're just pattern-matching rather than engineering.

## The Derivation Chain

Each axiom leads to emergent behaviors, which lead to design patterns:

```
Physics/Math Constraint
    ↓
Axiom (Inescapable Reality)
    ↓
Emergent Behavior
    ↓
System Challenges
    ↓
Design Patterns
    ↓
Trade-off Decisions
```

## How to Read This Section

### For First-Time Readers
1. Read axioms 1-3 first (The Trinity: Latency, Capacity, Failure)
2. Do the "Try This" exercises to internalize concepts
3. Read at least one failure story per axiom
4. Then proceed to remaining axioms

### For Experienced Engineers
1. Skim axiom definitions
2. Focus on the derivations and counter-intuitive truths
3. Challenge our assertions—can you find exceptions?
4. Use decision trees for your current problems

### For Managers
1. Read axiom summaries and decision boxes
2. Focus on axioms 1, 3, 7, and 8
3. Study the failure stories—they're your cautionary tales
4. Use cost models for architecture decisions

## The Axiom Interaction Matrix

Axioms don't exist in isolation. They interact and compound:

| Interaction | Result |
|------------|---------|
| Latency × Coordination | Slow agreement protocols |
| Capacity × Failure | Resource exhaustion cascades |
| Concurrency × Observability | Heisenbugs |
| Human × Economics | Operational cost explosion |
