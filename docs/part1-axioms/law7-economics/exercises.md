# Law 7 Exercises: Economic Reality

## Exercise 1: Calculate Your Technical Debt Interest Rate

Using the compound interest calculator from the main content:

1. List 5 technical shortcuts your team has taken
2. Estimate the initial time saved (in hours)
3. Track the ongoing maintenance cost (hours/week)
4. Calculate the annual interest rate
5. Project the total cost over 3 years

**Reflection**: Which shortcut has the highest interest rate? Why?

## Exercise 2: Build vs Buy Analysis

Choose a real system component your team needs:

1. Estimate build hours (be honest!)
2. Apply the 2.5x multiplier
3. Add maintenance (20% annually)
4. Calculate opportunity cost
5. Find 3 commercial alternatives
6. Run the TCO comparison

**Deliverable**: Executive summary with recommendation

## Exercise 3: Cloud Cost Archaeology

Analyze your last 3 months of cloud bills:

1. Identify top 10 cost drivers
2. Calculate cost per transaction/user
3. Find zombie resources
4. Estimate data transfer costs
5. Project next quarter's spend

**Goal**: Find 30% potential savings

## Exercise 4: Vendor Lock-in Assessment

For your primary cloud/SaaS vendors:

1. Calculate monthly spend
2. Estimate data size to migrate
3. Count API dependencies
4. Calculate migration cost
5. Determine break-even timeline

**Output**: Risk heat map of vendor dependencies

## Exercise 5: Create Your Cost Dashboard

Build a dashboard showing:

1. Daily burn rate
2. Cost per service
3. Efficiency metrics (revenue/cost)
4. Trend projections
5. Alert thresholds

**Success Criteria**: Catch cost anomalies within 24 hours

## Capstone: The CFO Presentation

Create a 10-slide deck that:

1. Shows current cost reality
2. Identifies optimization opportunities
3. Calculates ROI of proposed changes
4. Presents 90-day action plan
5. Projects 12-month savings

**Challenge**: Get it approved by actual leadership

## Discussion Questions

1. Why do engineers systematically underestimate costs?
2. How does Conway's Law affect economic decisions?
3. What's the relationship between technical debt and financial debt?
4. How do you balance innovation with cost control?
5. What economic metrics should every engineer know?

## Real-World Scenario

Your startup has $2M runway and burns $200K/month. You can:
- Option A: Build perfect architecture (6 months, $1.2M)
- Option B: Quick and dirty (2 months, $400K + technical debt)
- Option C: Buy and customize (1 month, $100K + $20K/month)

Model the outcomes for each path. Which leads to profitability? Which leads to bankruptcy?
