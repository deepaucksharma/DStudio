# Capacity Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Queue Simulation
Build and visualize different queue behaviors under varying loads.

### Lab 2: Capacity Planning
Use Little's Law to plan system capacity for given SLAs.

### Lab 3: Load Testing
Observe the utilization cliff in a real system.

### Lab 4: Find Your Breaking Point
Use the provided load testing scripts to discover system limits.

## Challenge Problems

1. Calculate the optimal utilization target for different resource types
2. Design a system that gracefully degrades at capacity limits
3. Implement different queue disciplines and compare their behavior
4. Build a backpressure mechanism with exponential backoff

## Thought Experiments

- What happens when you scale horizontally but forget about shared resources?
- How would you design a system that never hits capacity limits?
- When is it better to drop requests vs queueing them?
