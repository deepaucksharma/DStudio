# Observability Exercises

## Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Build a Structured Logger
Implement the structured logging example with additional features.

### Lab 2: Four Golden Signals Dashboard
Create a monitoring dashboard for a sample application.

### Lab 3: Trace Sampling Strategy
Design an adaptive sampling strategy that balances cost and visibility.

### Lab 4: Alert Design
Create alerts that minimize false positives while catching real issues.

## Challenge Problems

1. Calculate the cost of different observability strategies
2. Design a system to detect anomalies without explicit thresholds
3. Implement correlation ID propagation across async boundaries
4. Build a simple APM (Application Performance Monitoring) system

## Thought Experiments

- How would you observe a system with a $10/month budget?
- What's the minimum observability needed for a life-critical system?
- How do you observe the observers (meta-monitoring)?
