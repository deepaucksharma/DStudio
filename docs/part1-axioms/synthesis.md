### How to Read Your System's Shape

1. **Spike on one axis**: Optimize for that constraint
2. **Balanced polygon**: General-purpose architecture
3. **Flat shape**: Over-engineered or under-specified
4. **Irregular**: Different subsystems have different needs

### Example Profiles

**Real-time Bidding System**:
```
Latency:       ████████████ (10/10) - 100ms budget
Capacity:      ████████ (8/10) - 1M requests/sec
Failure:       ████ (4/10) - Some loss acceptable
Coordination:  ██ (2/10) - Read mostly
Cost:          ████████ (8/10) - Every ms costs money
```

**Batch Analytics Platform**:
```
Latency:       ██ (2/10) - Hours acceptable
Capacity:      ██████████ (10/10) - Petabytes
Failure:       ████ (4/10) - Can retry
Coordination:  ████████ (8/10) - Complex DAGs
Cost:          ██████████ (10/10) - Main constraint
```

Data corruption     Concurrency      Observability       ACID, validation
Slow death          Capacity         Observability       Metrics, alerts
Lost messages       Partial Failure  Observability       Acks, tracing
Clock skew          Coordination     Concurrency         NTP, logical time

```

### The Axiom Interaction Effects

```
When Axioms Combine:
- Latency + Coordination = Distributed transaction pain
- Capacity + Partial Failure = Cascade failures
- Concurrency + Observability = Heisenbugs
- Cost + Coordination = Expensive consistency
- Human + Partial Failure = Confusion under pressure
```

## Part II Preview

Having established the 8 fundamental axioms that govern all distributed systems, Part II will show how these constraints combine to create the five foundational pillars of distributed system design:

1. **Distribution of Work**: How to spread computation (emerges from Capacity + Latency axioms)
2. **Distribution of State**: How to spread data (emerges from Capacity + Partial Failure + Latency)  
3. **Distribution of Truth**: How to achieve agreement (emerges from Coordination + Concurrency + Partial Failure)
4. **Distribution of Control**: How to manage the system (emerges from Human Interface + Observability)
5. **Distribution of Intelligence**: How to make systems adaptive (emerges from all axioms + feedback loops)

These pillars aren't arbitrary categorizations—they're the natural solutions that emerge when you apply first-principles thinking to the fundamental constraints we've just explored.
