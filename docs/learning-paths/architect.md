# Solution Architect Learning Path

!!! abstract "Architect at Scale"
 This path is designed for architects who design and oversee large-scale distributed systems. You'll master the art of making architectural decisions that balance technical excellence with business needs.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

As a solution architect, you will:

- Design systems that scale to millions of users globally
- Make architectural decisions balancing 20+ competing concerns
- Create reference architectures and design patterns
- Evaluate and select appropriate technologies
- Guide organizations through digital transformation
- Communicate complex architectures to diverse stakeholders

## üìö Prerequisites

- 7+ years of software engineering experience
- 3+ years designing distributed systems
- Experience with multiple cloud platforms
- Strong understanding of enterprise architecture
- Business acumen and stakeholder management skills
