## üí° Cost Optimization Wisdom

!!! tip "FinOps Best Practices"
 1. **Measure Everything**: You can't optimize what you don't measure
 2. **Automate Ruthlessly**: Manual optimization doesn't scale
 3. **Shift Left**: Consider cost during design, not after
 4. **Regular Reviews**: Costs drift without attention
 5. **Team Ownership**: Everyone owns their costs
