# Event-Driven Systems Learning Path

**Essential Question**: *How do I design and build event-driven systems that handle millions of events with guaranteed delivery and ordering?*

> **What You'll Master**: Complete event-driven architecture - from event modeling to production streaming platforms that power modern applications.

## üéØ Learning Journey Overview

Event-driven architecture is like designing a bustling city's communication system - instead of everyone calling everyone directly, you create efficient message routing that allows components to communicate asynchronously, scale independently, and respond to changes in real-time. This path teaches you to model events, design message flows, implement streaming platforms, and build systems that react to business events as they occur.
