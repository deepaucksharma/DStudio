# Microservices Systems Learning Path

**Essential Question**: *How do I design, build, and operate microservices systems that scale from thousands to millions of users?*

> **What You'll Master**: Complete microservices lifecycle - from identifying service boundaries to operating them at scale in production.

## üéØ Learning Journey Overview

Microservices architecture is like organizing a large company - instead of one massive department handling everything, you create specialized teams that communicate effectively to deliver business value. This path teaches you to decompose monoliths into services, design resilient communication patterns, manage distributed data, and operate complex systems in production.
