# Data-Intensive Systems Learning Path

**Essential Question**: *How do I design and build data systems that process, store, and analyze massive datasets with high reliability and performance?*

> **What You'll Master**: Complete data system architecture - from storage engines to distributed analytics platforms that handle petabytes of data for companies like Netflix, Uber, and Google.

## üéØ Learning Journey Overview

Data-intensive systems are like designing a massive library system for the digital age - you need efficient storage, fast retrieval, reliable cataloging, and the ability to serve millions of simultaneous users while continuously growing. This path teaches you to design storage systems, build processing pipelines, handle consistency models, implement real-time analytics, and operate systems that process terabytes daily.
