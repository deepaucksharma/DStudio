# New Graduate Learning Path

!!! abstract "Your Journey Begins"
 Welcome to distributed systems! This learning path is designed for recent graduates and engineers with 0-2 years of experience. You'll build a solid foundation in distributed systems principles before diving into real-world applications.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this path, you will:

- Understand the fundamental laws governing distributed systems
- Build intuition about trade-offs in system design
- Learn essential patterns used in production systems
- Develop skills to participate in system design discussions
- Prepare for distributed systems interviews

## üìö Recommended Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience (any language)
- Understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Familiarity with networking concepts (TCP/IP, HTTP)
- Basic database knowledge (SQL, ACID properties)

## üó∫Ô∏è Your Learning Journey

### Phase 1: Foundations (2-3 weeks)

!!! tip "Start Here"
 Begin with the core concepts that govern all distributed systems.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **Week 1: The 7 Laws**
 
 Start with understanding the fundamental constraints:
 
 1. [Law 1: Correlated Failure](/part1-axioms/law1-failure/index) - Why things fail together
 2. [Law 2: Asynchronous Reality](/part1-axioms/law2-asynchrony/index) - Time and ordering challenges
 3. [Law 3: Emergent Chaos](/part1-axioms/law3-emergence/index) - Complexity from simplicity

- **Week 2: Core Concepts**
 
 Continue with practical implications:
 
 4. [Law 4: Multidimensional Optimization](/part1-axioms/law4-tradeoffs/index) - Understanding trade-offs
 5. [Law 5: Distributed Knowledge](/part1-axioms/law5-epistemology/index) - Information challenges
 6. [Law 6: Cognitive Load](/part1-axioms/law6-human-api/index) - Human factors

- **Week 3: Economics & Pillars**
 
 Complete foundations:
 
 7. [Law 7: Economic Reality](/part1-axioms/law7-economics/index) - Cost considerations
 8. [The 5 Pillars Overview](/part2-pillars) - Distribution strategies

### Phase 2: Essential Patterns (3-4 weeks)

!!! info "Build Your Toolkit"
 Learn the patterns you'll use every day in distributed systems.

#### Week 4-5: Resilience Patterns

Start with patterns that keep systems running:

- [Retry & Backoff](/patterns/retry-backoff) - Handling transient failures
- [Circuit Breaker](/patterns/circuit-breaker) - Preventing cascade failures
- [Timeout](/patterns/timeout) - Avoiding indefinite waits
- [Health Check](/patterns/health-check) - Monitoring system health

#### Week 6: Data Patterns

Understand how data flows in distributed systems:

- [Caching Strategies](/patterns/caching-strategies) - Performance optimization
- [Event Sourcing](/patterns/event-sourcing) - Event-driven architectures
- [CQRS](/patterns/cqrs) - Separating reads and writes

#### Week 7: Coordination Patterns

Learn how systems work together:

- [Service Discovery](/patterns/service-discovery) - Finding services
- [Load Balancing](/patterns/load-balancing) - Distributing work
- [API Gateway](/patterns/api-gateway) - Central entry points

### Phase 3: Real-World Applications (2-3 weeks)

!!! success "Apply Your Knowledge"
 See how theory meets practice in production systems.

#### Week 8-9: Case Studies

Study real implementations:

- [Chat System Design](/case-studies/chat-system) - WhatsApp-like messaging
- [URL Shortener](/case-studies/url-shortener) - Bit.ly architecture
- [Key-Value Store](/case-studies/key-value-store) - Redis-like system

#### Week 10: Quantitative Skills

Build your analytical toolkit:

- [Latency Ladder](/quantitative/latency-ladder) - Performance intuition
- [Little's Law](/quantitative/littles-law) - Queue theory basics
- [CAP Theorem](/quantitative/cap-theorem) - Fundamental trade-offs

### Phase 4: Interview Preparation (1-2 weeks)

!!! warning "Practice Makes Perfect"
 Consolidate your learning with interview-focused practice.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **System Design Basics**
 - [Common Mistakes](/google-interviews/google-interviews/common-mistakes/)
 - [Preparation Guide](/google-interviews/google-interviews/preparation-guide/)
 - [Visual Cheat Sheets](/google-interviews/visual-cheatsheets/)

- **Mock Problems**
 - Design a chat application
 - Build a URL shortener
 - Create a distributed cache
