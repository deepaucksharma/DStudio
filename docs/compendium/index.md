# The Compendium of Distributed Systems

!!! abstract "A First-Principles Journey"
    Welcome to a revolutionary approach to understanding distributed systems. Instead of memorizing patterns, we derive them from fundamental physical and mathematical constraints.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Navigation

### By Experience Level

=== "New Graduate"
    1. Start with [Front Matter](front-matter.md) â†’ Reader Roadmap
    2. Focus on [Axioms 1-3](axioms-1-5.md#axiom-1-latency)
    3. Try the hands-on exercises marked with ðŸ”§
    4. Read the failure vignettes marked with ðŸŽ¬

=== "Senior Engineer"
    1. Review all [Axioms 1-5](axioms-1-5.md)
    2. Study the decision frameworks marked with ðŸŽ¯
    3. Examine the mathematical proofs
    4. Apply patterns to your current systems

=== "Engineering Manager"
    1. Read [Axioms 1, 3, and 5](axioms-1-5.md) (Latency, Failure, Coordination)
    2. Focus on cost implications
    3. Review failure vignettes for postmortem insights
    4. Use decision frameworks for architecture reviews

### By Problem Type

| If you're dealing with... | Start here |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Slow response times | [Axiom 1: Latency](axioms-1-5.md#axiom-1-latency) |
| System overload | [Axiom 2: Capacity](axioms-1-5.md#axiom-2-finite-capacity) |
| Cascading failures | [Axiom 3: Partial Failure](axioms-1-5.md#axiom-3-partial-failure) |
| Race conditions | [Axiom 4: Concurrency](axioms-1-5.md#axiom-4-concurrency) |
| High cross-region costs | [Axiom 5: Coordination](axioms-1-5.md#axiom-5-cost-of-coordination) |

!!! quote "The Universal Truth"
    "Every distributed system pattern is a workaround for physics."

### The Eight Axioms at a Glance

1. **Latency** - You can't beat the speed of light
2. **Finite Capacity** - Everything breaks eventually  
3. **Partial Failure** - Some parts work while others don't
4. **Concurrency** - Time is relative between nodes
5. **Coordination Cost** - Agreement is expensive
6. **Time** - There is no "now" in distributed systems
7. **Ordering** - Events happen, but in what order?
8. **Knowledge** - You can never know everything
