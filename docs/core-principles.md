# Core Principles

The foundation of distributed systems mastery lies in understanding fundamental laws and architectural pillars.

## The 7 Fundamental Laws

Every distributed system, regardless of scale or complexity, is governed by these immutable laws:

1. **[Correlated Failure](core-principles/laws/correlated-failure.md)** - Failures rarely occur alone
2. **[Asynchronous Reality](core-principles/laws/asynchronous-reality.md)** - Time is never synchronized
3. **[Emergent Chaos](core-principles/laws/emergent-chaos.md)** - Complexity breeds unpredictability
4. **[Multidimensional Optimization](core-principles/laws/multidimensional-optimization.md)** - Every design is a trade-off
5. **[Distributed Knowledge](core-principles/laws/distributed-knowledge.md)** - Knowledge is always partial
6. **[Cognitive Load](core-principles/laws/cognitive-load.md)** - Humans have limits
7. **[Economic Reality](core-principles/laws/economic-reality.md)** - Cost shapes architecture

## The 5 Architectural Pillars

Built upon these laws, five pillars guide practical system design:

1. **[Work Distribution](core-principles/pillars/work-distribution.md)** - How to divide computation
2. **[Control Distribution](core-principles/pillars/control-distribution.md)** - How to coordinate decisions
3. **[State Distribution](core-principles/pillars/state-distribution.md)** - How to manage data
4. **[Truth Distribution](core-principles/pillars/truth-distribution.md)** - How to establish consensus
5. **[Information Flow](core-principles/pillars/information-flow.md)** - How to move data

## Pattern Application

These principles manifest in concrete patterns:

- **[Pattern Library](pattern-library/)** - 100+ battle-tested patterns
- **[Case Studies](architects-handbook/case-studies/)** - Real-world applications
- **[Implementation Guides](excellence/implementation-guides/)** - Practical blueprints

## Start Your Journey

Begin with [Law 1: Correlated Failure](core-principles/laws/correlated-failure.md) - it's the foundation everything else builds upon.
