!!! target "Learning Objective"
    Apply everything you've learned by building a real distributed system from scratch. By the end, you'll have a working distributed key-value store that handles failures, maintains consistency, and scales horizontally.

## Overview

<div class="capstone-intro">

Welcome to the culmination of your distributed systems journey! In this capstone project, you'll build **DistKV** - a distributed key-value store that embodies all the principles and patterns you've learned.

**Why a key-value store?**
- **Simple interface**: Just GET, PUT, DELETE operations
- **Rich in challenges**: All distributed systems problems appear
- **Industry relevant**: Redis, DynamoDB, Cassandra all started here
- **Extensible**: Can evolve into a database, cache, or message queue

## Common Pitfalls

!!! warning "Watch Out For These"
    
    1. **Networking assumptions**: TCP doesn't guarantee message boundaries
    2. **Time synchronization**: Clocks drift, use logical timestamps
    3. **Failure detection**: Network partitions vs node failures
    4. **Data consistency**: Read-your-writes vs eventual consistency
    5. **Performance**: Premature optimization vs profiling
