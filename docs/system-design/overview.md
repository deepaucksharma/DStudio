# System Design Overview

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves making high-level design decisions about how to structure and organize a system.

## Key Principles

### Scalability
The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources to the system.

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to the pool of resources
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to existing machines

### Reliability
The probability a system performs correctly during a specific time duration.

- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating despite component failures
- **Redundancy**: Having backup components or systems
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality

### Availability
The percentage of time a system is operational and accessible when required.

- **Uptime**: Time system is operational
- **Downtime**: Time system is not operational
- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement defining expected availability

## Common Patterns

### Load Balancing
Distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.

### Caching
Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage to reduce response times.

### Database Partitioning
Splitting data across multiple databases to improve performance and scalability.

### Microservices
Breaking down applications into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs.

## Design Process

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Understanding functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Capacity Planning**: Estimating scale and performance requirements
3. **High-Level Design**: Creating overall system architecture
4. **Detailed Design**: Defining specific components and their interactions
5. **Implementation**: Building the system
6. **Testing**: Validating the design meets requirements
7. **Deployment**: Releasing the system to production
8. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring system performance and health
