## Emergency Fixes

### 🔥 Production Fire? Here's Your Toolkit

| Problem | Immediate Fix | Time to Deploy | Root Cause Analysis |
| **Service failures cascading** | [Circuit Breaker](../pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker.md) | 1 hour | [Law of Correlated Failure](../core-principles/laws/correlated-failure.md) |
| **Database overwhelmed** | [Read replicas + Caching](../pattern-library/scaling/caching-strategies.md) | 2 hours | [State Distribution Pillar](../core-principles/pillars/state-distribution.md) |
| **API rate limit breaches** | [Rate Limiting](../pattern-library/scaling/rate-limiting.md) + [Backpressure](../pattern-library/scaling/backpressure.md) | 30 mins | [Work Distribution Pillar](../core-principles/pillars/work-distribution.md) |
| **Data inconsistency** | [Saga pattern](../pattern-library/data-management/saga.md) or [2PC](../pattern-library/coordination/two-phase-commit.md) | 4 hours | [Truth Distribution Pillar](../core-principles/pillars/truth-distribution.md) |
| **Service discovery failing** | [Service Registry](../pattern-library/communication/service-registry.md) + [Health Checks](../pattern-library/observability/health-checks.md) | 1 hour | [Control Distribution Pillar](../core-principles/pillars/control-distribution.md) |
| **Memory/CPU spikes** | [Bulkhead](../pattern-library/resilience/bulkhead.md) + [Load Shedding](../pattern-library/scaling/load-shedding.md) | 45 mins | [Law of Emergent Chaos](../core-principles/laws/emergent-chaos.md) |
| **Network partitions** | [Partition Tolerance Patterns](../pattern-library/resilience/partition-tolerance.md) | 2 hours | [Law of Asynchronous Reality](../core-principles/laws/asynchronous-reality.md) |

**🎯 Quick Win:** Start with [Circuit Breaker](../pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker.md) — it prevents 80% of cascade failures and takes <1 hour to implement.

### Decision Framework

Use this quick decision tree:

```
Is your main challenge:
  │
  ├─ Performance? → Start with: Caching → CDN → Read Replicas → Sharding
  ├─ Reliability? → Start with: Circuit Breaker → Retry → Bulkhead → Chaos Engineering  
  ├─ Scalability? → Start with: Load Balancing → Auto-scaling → Horizontal Partitioning
  └─ Consistency? → Start with: Saga → Event Sourcing → CQRS → Distributed Transactions
```
