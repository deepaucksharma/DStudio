# Documentation Style Guide

This style guide ensures consistency, clarity, and professionalism across all DStudio distributed systems documentation.

## 📝 Writing Tone Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Concise**: Every word serves a purpose
- **Factual**: Claims backed by evidence and data
- **Evidence-based**: Real-world examples and industry practices
- **Accessible**: Technical content explained clearly
- **Actionable**: Practical guidance over theoretical discussions

### Voice and Tone

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Technical Explanations** | Authoritative, clear | "Circuit Breaker prevents cascade failures by monitoring error rates" |
| **Tutorial Steps** | Helpful, direct | "Configure the retry interval to 100ms for optimal performance" |
| **Architecture Decisions** | Analytical, balanced | "Consider the trade-offs: consistency vs availability" |
| **Performance Warnings** | Urgent but professional | "This configuration can cause memory leaks in high-traffic scenarios" |

### Language Standards
- **Active voice**: "The load balancer distributes requests" (not "Requests are distributed")
- **Present tense**: "The system handles failures" (not "The system will handle failures")
- **Specific numbers**: "Reduces latency by 40%" (not "significantly reduces latency")
- **Avoid jargon**: Define technical terms on first use

## 💻 Code Example Formatting Standards

### Code Block Guidelines

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, commented, realistic
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        """
        Initialize circuit breaker with production-ready defaults.
        
        Args:
            failure_threshold: Failed calls before opening circuit
            timeout: Seconds before attempting to close circuit
        """
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute function with circuit breaker protection."""
        if self._should_open_circuit():
            raise CircuitBreakerOpenError("Circuit breaker is OPEN")
            
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._record_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._record_failure()
            raise
```

```python
# ❌ Avoid: Uncommented, unrealistic
def cb(f, t=5):
    if bad: raise Error
    return f()
```

### Configuration Examples

```yaml
# ✅ Production-ready configuration with comments
load_balancer:
  algorithm: weighted_round_robin  # Better than simple round_robin for mixed instance sizes
  health_check:
    interval: 30s                  # Balance between responsiveness and overhead
    timeout: 10s                   # Must be less than interval
    unhealthy_threshold: 3         # Avoid flapping from single failures
  
circuit_breaker:
    failure_threshold: 10          # Based on 1% error rate at 1000 req/min
    timeout: 60s                   # Allow system to recover
    half_open_max_calls: 3         # Conservative testing
```

## 📚 Citation and Sourcing Requirements

### Industry Sources
```markdown
According to Netflix's 2023 engineering blog, their circuit breaker implementation 
reduces cascade failures by 95% during partial outages¹.

¹ Netflix Engineering Blog, "Circuit Breakers at Scale", March 2023
```

### Academic Papers
```markdown
The CAP theorem, formally proven by Gilbert and Lynch (2002), demonstrates 
the fundamental trade-offs in distributed systems².

² Gilbert, S. and Lynch, N. (2002). "Brewer's conjecture and the feasibility 
of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services." ACM SIGACT News, 33(2).
```

### Code and Architecture References
```markdown
This implementation follows the patterns established in Netflix Hystrix³ 
and adopted by Envoy Proxy⁴.

## 🧮 Mathematical Notation Conventions

### Performance Metrics
```markdown
**Latency Reduction**:
- P95 latency: 250ms → 45ms (82% improvement)
- P99 latency: 1.2s → 180ms (85% improvement)

**Throughput Calculation**:
Throughput = Requests/Second × Success_Rate
- Before: 1000 req/s × 0.95 = 950 successful req/s
- After: 1000 req/s × 0.99 = 990 successful req/s
```

### Capacity Planning
```markdown
**Little's Law Application**:
L = λ × W

Where:
- L = Average number of requests in system
- λ = Request arrival rate (1000 req/s)  
- W = Average response time (100ms)

Therefore: L = 1000 × 0.1 = 100 concurrent requests
```

### Availability Calculations
```markdown
**System Availability**:
Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)

Example:
- MTBF: 720 hours (30 days)
- MTTR: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Availability = 720 / (720 + 0.5) = 99.93%
```
