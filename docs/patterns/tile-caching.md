# Tile Caching

**Optimize map rendering with pre-computed tile pyramids**

> *"Why render the world every time when you can cache it once?"*

## Overview

Tile caching optimizes the storage and delivery of map tiles by pre-rendering and caching spatial data at multiple zoom levels. This pattern is fundamental to modern mapping applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Tile Pyramid**: Pre-rendered tiles at multiple zoom levels
- **Cache Hierarchy**: Multi-level caching from edge to origin
- **Invalidation Strategy**: Updating tiles when data changes
