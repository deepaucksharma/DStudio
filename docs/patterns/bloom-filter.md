# Bloom Filter Pattern

**Space-efficient probabilistic set membership testing**

> *This pattern is currently under development. Content will be added soon.*

## Overview

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that tests whether an element is a member of a set. It can have false positives but never false negatives.

## Key Properties

- **No false negatives**: If it says "not in set", it's definitely not
- **Possible false positives**: If it says "in set", it might be wrong
- **Space efficient**: Uses bit array with hash functions
- **Fast operations**: O(k) for add/check, where k = number of hash functions

## Common Use Cases

- Cache filtering
- Duplicate detection
- Database query optimization
- Distributed systems coordination

## Trade-offs

- ✅ Very space efficient
- ✅ Fast lookups
- ✅ No false negatives
- ❌ False positives possible
- ❌ Cannot delete elements
- ❌ Cannot retrieve elements
