# Vector Clocks Pattern

**Tracking causality and ordering of events in distributed systems**

> *This pattern is currently under development. Content will be added soon.*

## Overview

Vector clocks are a mechanism for tracking causality and determining the ordering of events in distributed systems where nodes don't share a global clock.

## How Vector Clocks Work

1. Each node maintains a vector of logical clocks
2. Vector has one entry per node in the system
3. On local event: increment own entry
4. On send: attach current vector to message
5. On receive: update vector with max of each entry

## Key Properties

- **Causality Detection**: Can determine if events are causally related
- **Concurrent Detection**: Identifies truly concurrent events
- **Partial Ordering**: Establishes happens-before relationships

## Use Cases

- Distributed databases (Dynamo, Riak)
- Version control systems
- Distributed debugging
- Conflict detection and resolution

## Trade-offs

- ✅ Accurate causality tracking
- ✅ Detects concurrent updates
- ✅ No synchronized clocks needed
- ❌ O(n) space per message
- ❌ Complexity increases with nodes
- ❌ Requires node identity
