# Kappa Architecture

!!! danger "ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Superseded by more practical approaches**
    
    Kappa architecture's pure streaming approach seemed elegant but proved impractical for many use cases. Lambda architecture and modern unified processing frameworks offer better solutions.
    
    **Use modern alternatives:**
    - **Apache Beam** for unified batch/stream processing
    - **Flink** for stateful stream processing
    - **Kafka Streams** for event streaming
