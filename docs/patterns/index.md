# Patterns

## Derived Design Patterns

Every pattern in distributed systems emerges from the fundamental axioms. This section shows how to derive patterns from first principles rather than memorizing them.

## Pattern Categories

### Pattern Categories

We organize patterns by the constraints they address:

**Communication Patterns** - Address latency and failure constraints  
**Data Patterns** - Handle capacity and consistency constraints  
**Consistency Patterns** - Manage coordination costs  
**Control Patterns** - Handle human interface and economic constraints

### Coming Soon

Detailed patterns are being developed based on the axiom foundations. Each pattern will show:
- Which axioms it addresses
- Mathematical derivation from constraints
- Trade-offs and alternatives
- Real-world examples
