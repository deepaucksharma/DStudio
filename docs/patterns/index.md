## How Patterns Relate to Laws

Each pattern addresses specific axiom constraints:

```proto
Pattern               Primary Laws        Trade-offs
-------               --------------        ----------
Circuit Breaker       Failure, Latency      Availability vs Accuracy
CQRS                 Concurrency, State    Consistency vs Complexity
Event Sourcing       State, Time           Storage vs Flexibility
Service Mesh         Coordination, Obs     Performance vs Features
Sharding             Capacity, State       Scalability vs Complexity
Rate Limiting        Capacity, Economics   Protection vs User Experience
Distributed Lock     Coordination, Failure Consistency vs Availability
Auto-Scaling         Capacity, Economics   Cost vs Response Time
Load Balancing       Capacity, Latency     Fairness vs Efficiency
Timeout              Latency, Failure      Responsiveness vs Completeness
```

## Real-World Pattern Usage

### Circuit Breaker at Netflix
Netflix's Hystrix library‚Åπ implements circuit breakers that handle over 100 billion thread-isolated and 10 billion semaphore-isolated command executions per day. When a service fails, Hystrix prevents cascading failures by "opening the circuit" and serving fallback responses.

### CQRS at LinkedIn
LinkedIn uses CQRS¬π‚Å∞ to separate their write-heavy profile updates from read-heavy timeline generation, allowing them to optimize each path independently and serve billions of timeline reads daily.

### Event Sourcing at Walmart
Walmart's order management system¬π¬π uses event sourcing to track the complete history of each order, enabling them to reconstruct any order state and handle complex scenarios like partial refunds and multi-step fulfillment.

### Service Mesh at Lyft
Lyft's Envoy proxy¬π¬≤ (which became the foundation for Istio) handles over 100 million requests per second across their microservices, providing load balancing, circuit breaking, and observability without changing application code.

## Pattern Decision Matrix

| Problem | Solution Pattern |
|---------|------------------|
| High Latency | Caching |
| System Overload | Rate Limiting |
| Data Inconsistency | CQRS |
| Service Failures | Circuit Breaker |
| Complex Transactions | Saga |

## Using This Section

**Architects**: Start with [Pattern Comparison](pattern-comparison.md) ‚Üí [Pattern Selector](pattern-selector.md) ‚Üí [Combinations](pattern-combinations.md)

**Engineers**: Follow learning paths ‚Üí Study implementations ‚Üí Practice with code samples

**Leaders**: Review comparison matrix ‚Üí Evaluate economics ‚Üí Consider operational fit

## Pattern Selection Framework

1. **Problem Fit** - Does it solve your actual problem?
2. **Complexity Cost** - Can your team operate it?
3. **Performance Impact** - What's the overhead?
4. **Economic Viability** - Is it cost-effective?
5. **Future Flexibility** - Does it lock you in?

### Example: 10K req/s with 99.9% availability

| Option | Cost/Month | Complexity | Availability | Verdict |
|--------|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Load Balancer + Retries | $500 | Low | 99.5% | ‚ùå Below requirement |
| Service Mesh + Circuit Breakers | $2000 | High | 99.95% | ‚úÖ If team trained |
| Serverless + API Gateway | $1000-3000 | Medium | 99.99% | ‚úÖ Best balance |

## Key Takeaways

### üìö Universal Principles

1. **Patterns emerge from constraints** - Every pattern solves specific axiom limitations
2. **Trade-offs are mandatory** - No free lunch
3. **Context determines choice** - Same problem + different constraints = different pattern
4. **Simple beats complex** - Start with simplest working solution
5. **Operations are paramount** - Must operate at 3 AM
6. **Measure everything** - Quantify benefits and costs
7. **Evolution over revolution** - Migrate incrementally

### üìã Pattern Selection Checklist

**Before**: ‚úì Constraint mapping ‚úì Team readiness ‚úì ROI calculation ‚úì Fallback plan ‚úì Success metrics

**During**: ‚úì Incremental rollout ‚úì Monitoring ‚úì Documentation ‚úì Team training

**After**: ‚úì Regular review ‚úì Cost tracking ‚úì Failure analysis ‚úì Evolution planning
