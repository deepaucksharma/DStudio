# Part III: Modern Architectural Patterns

**Proven solutions derived from fundamental constraints**

## Overview

Every pattern in distributed systems emerges from the fundamental axioms. This section presents battle-tested patterns that address real-world distributed systems challenges.

## Pattern Categories

### Core Patterns
Fundamental architectural patterns that shape modern distributed systems:

- **[Queues & Streaming](queues-streaming.md)** - Decoupling producers from consumers
- **[CQRS](cqrs.md)** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **[Event-Driven Architecture](event-driven.md)** - Choreography over orchestration
- **[Event Sourcing](event-sourcing.md)** - State as a sequence of events
- **[Saga Pattern](saga.md)** - Distributed transaction management
- **[Service Mesh](service-mesh.md)** - Infrastructure layer for service communication
- **[GraphQL Federation](graphql-federation.md)** - Unified data graph across services
- **[Serverless/FaaS](serverless-faas.md)** - Functions as the unit of deployment

### Resilience Patterns
Patterns that ensure systems survive failures:

- **[Circuit Breaker](circuit-breaker.md)** - Preventing cascade failures
- **[Retry & Backoff](retry-backoff.md)** - Intelligent retry strategies
- **[Bulkhead](bulkhead.md)** - Failure isolation through partitioning
- **[Edge Computing](edge-computing.md)** - Processing at the periphery

### Data Patterns
Managing data in distributed environments:

- **[CDC (Change Data Capture)](cdc.md)** - Real-time data synchronization
- **[Tunable Consistency](tunable-consistency.md)** - Flexible consistency guarantees
- **[Sharding](sharding.md)** - Horizontal data partitioning
- **[Caching Strategies](caching-strategies.md)** - Multi-level cache hierarchies
- **[Geo-Replication](geo-replication.md)** - Global data distribution

### Operational Patterns
Patterns for running systems in production:

- **[Observability](observability.md)** - Metrics, logs, and traces
- **[FinOps](finops.md)** - Cloud cost optimization

## How Patterns Relate to Axioms

Each pattern addresses specific axiom constraints:

```
Pattern               Primary Axioms        Trade-offs
-------               --------------        ----------
Circuit Breaker       Failure, Latency      Availability vs Accuracy
CQRS                 Concurrency, State    Consistency vs Complexity
Event Sourcing       State, Time           Storage vs Flexibility
Service Mesh         Coordination, Obs     Performance vs Features
Sharding             Capacity, State       Scalability vs Complexity
```

## Using This Section

### For Architects
1. Start with the problem you're solving
2. Identify which axioms create the constraint
3. Choose patterns that address those constraints
4. Understand the trade-offs

### For Engineers
1. Study the implementation details
2. Understand failure modes
3. Learn from real-world examples
4. Practice with the code samples

### For Technical Leaders
1. Understand pattern economics
2. Evaluate organizational fit
3. Plan migration strategies
4. Consider operational complexity

## Pattern Selection Framework

When choosing patterns, consider:

1. **Problem Fit** - Does it solve your actual problem?
2. **Complexity Cost** - Can your team operate it?
3. **Performance Impact** - What's the overhead?
4. **Economic Viability** - Is it cost-effective?
5. **Future Flexibility** - Does it lock you in?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Pattern Cargo Cult** - Using patterns because others do
- **Premature Distribution** - Distributing before necessary
- **Consistency Theater** - Over-engineering consistency
- **Resume-Driven Architecture** - Choosing for career reasons
- **Infinite Scalability** - Ignoring practical limits

## Key Takeaways

- **Patterns emerge from constraints** - They're not arbitrary
- **Every pattern has trade-offs** - No free lunch
- **Context matters** - Same problem, different context, different pattern
- **Simplicity wins** - Start simple, evolve as needed
- **Operations matter** - Can you run it at 3 AM?
