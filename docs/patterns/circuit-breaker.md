# Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Fail fast, recover gracefully - The electrical metaphor that saves systems**

> *"Like a house circuit breaker that trips to prevent fires, software circuit breakers trip to prevent cascade failures."*

!!! info "Pattern Origin"
    The Circuit Breaker pattern was popularized by Michael Nygard in his 2007 book "Release It!"¬π as a solution to cascading failures in distributed systems. Netflix later open-sourced Hystrix¬≤ in 2012, making the pattern widely adopted in microservices architectures.

## üéØ Level 1: Intuition

### The House Circuit Breaker Analogy

Imagine your home's electrical panel:

```text
üè† Normal Operation (CLOSED)
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ [‚óè] Kitchen     ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Circuit allows electricity to flow
‚îÇ [‚óè] Living Room ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [‚óè] Bedroom     ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ [?] Kitchen     ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Try small load, see if it works
‚îÇ [‚óè] Living Room ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [‚óè] Bedroom     ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**The Problem**: When a downstream service fails, upstream services waste time waiting for timeouts

**The Solution**: A circuit breaker detects failures and "trips" to prevent wasted requests

### Visual State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure Threshold Met
    Open --> HalfOpen: Recovery Timeout
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Test Success
    HalfOpen --> Open: Test Failure
    
    Closed: Allow all requests<br/>Monitor failures
    Open: Block all requests<br/>Fail fast
    HalfOpen: Allow test requests<br/>Check if recovered
```

### Simple State Machine

| State | Behavior | When to Transition |
|-------|----------|--------------------|
| **CLOSED** | Let requests through | After X failures ‚Üí OPEN |
| **OPEN** | Reject immediately | After timeout ‚Üí HALF-OPEN |
| **HALF-OPEN** | Test with few requests | Success ‚Üí CLOSED, Failure ‚Üí OPEN |

!!! example "Real-World Impact: Netflix's Hystrix"
    In 2012, Netflix implemented circuit breakers across their microservices architecture using Hystrix¬≥. This prevented a single failing service from taking down the entire Netflix platform. During a major AWS outage in 2012, Netflix remained operational while many other services failed, largely due to their circuit breaker implementation that isolated failures to specific regions‚Å¥.

## üèóÔ∏è Level 2: Foundation

### Core Principles

#### Failure Detection
Track failure metrics to determine service health:

| Metric Type | Example | Threshold | Industry Example |
|-------------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Error Rate** | 5 failures in 10 requests | 50% | Twitter: 1% error rate trips circuit‚Åµ |
| **Timeout Rate** | 3 timeouts in 5 requests | 60% | Amazon: 99.9th percentile latency trigger‚Å∂ |
| **Response Time** | Average > 5 seconds | 5s | Uber: P99 > 500ms opens circuit‚Å∑ |
| **Exception Count** | 10 consecutive errors | 10 | Stripe: 5 consecutive 5xx errors‚Å∏ |

#### State Transitions

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Circuit States"
        C[CLOSED<br/>Normal Operation]
        O[OPEN<br/>Failing Fast]
        H[HALF-OPEN<br/>Testing Recovery]
    end
    
    C -->|"Failures > Threshold"| O
    O -->|"Recovery Timeout"| H
    H -->|"Test Success"| C
    H -->|"Test Failure"| O
    
    style C fill:#90EE90
    style O fill:#FFB6C1
    style H fill:#FFE4B5
```

#### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Typical Value | Real-World Example |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Failure Threshold** | Errors before opening | 5-10 failures | Netflix: 20 failures in 10 seconds‚Åπ |
| **Recovery Timeout** | Time before testing | 30-60 seconds | LinkedIn: 30 seconds¬π‚Å∞ |
| **Success Threshold** | Successes to close | 2-5 successes | Airbnb: 3 consecutive successes¬π¬π |
| **Test Request Ratio** | % requests in half-open | 10-25% | Spotify: 10% test traffic¬π¬≤ |

### Implementation Flow

```text
CLOSED State:
  Request ‚Üí Try call ‚Üí Success: Reset counter
                    ‚Üí Failure: Count++ ‚Üí Threshold? ‚Üí OPEN

OPEN State:
  Request ‚Üí Timeout expired? ‚Üí Yes: HALF-OPEN
                            ‚Üí No: Reject immediately

HALF-OPEN State:
  Request ‚Üí Test call ‚Üí Success: Count++ ‚Üí Enough? ‚Üí CLOSED
                     ‚Üí Failure: OPEN
```

!!! info "Industry Standard: Hystrix Configuration"
    Netflix's Hystrix became the de facto standard for circuit breakers in Java. Their default configuration¬π¬≥:
    - Error threshold: 50% of requests fail
    - Request volume threshold: 20 requests in 10 seconds
    - Sleep window: 5 seconds
    - These defaults prevented 99% of cascading failures in Netflix's production environment

---

## üîß Level 3: Deep Dive

### Advanced Circuit Breaker Types

#### 1. Count-Based Circuit Breaker
Tracks absolute number of failures:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Sliding Window (Size: 10)"
        A[Success] --> B[Success]
        B --> C[Failure]
        C --> D[Success]
        D --> E[Failure]
        E --> F[Failure]
        F --> G[Failure]
        G --> H[Failure]
        H --> I[Success]
        I --> J[Failure]
    end
    
    J --> K{6 Failures > 5 Threshold?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Open Circuit]
    K -->|No| M[Keep Closed]
```

**Used by**: Google Cloud Endpoints¬π‚Å¥ (5 failures in 10 requests)

#### 2. Time-Based Circuit Breaker
Tracks failures within time windows:

```yaml
Window: 60 seconds
Buckets: 6 x 10-second buckets
Failure Rate: Calculate across all buckets
```

**Used by**: AWS Application Load Balancer¬π‚Åµ (unhealthy threshold over 30 seconds)

#### 3. Adaptive Circuit Breaker
Adjusts thresholds based on system load:

| Load Level | Error Threshold | Recovery Time |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Low (<100 RPS) | 50% | 60s |
| Medium (100-1000 RPS) | 20% | 30s |
| High (>1000 RPS) | 5% | 10s |

**Used by**: Twitter's Finagle¬π‚Å∂ (dynamic thresholds based on request rate)

### Production Considerations

#### 1. Bulkheading with Circuit Breakers

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Service A"
        CB1[Circuit Breaker 1<br/>Payment Service]
        CB2[Circuit Breaker 2<br/>Inventory Service]
        CB3[Circuit Breaker 3<br/>Shipping Service]
    end
    
    CB1 --> PS[Payment Service]
    CB2 --> IS[Inventory Service]
    CB3 --> SS[Shipping Service]
    
    style CB1 fill:#90EE90
    style CB2 fill:#FFB6C1
    style CB3 fill:#90EE90
```

**Real Example**: Amazon isolates each downstream service with its own circuit breaker, preventing payment failures from affecting inventory checks¬π‚Å∑.

#### 2. Fallback Strategies

| Strategy | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Default Value** | Non-critical data | Netflix: Show generic thumbnails¬π‚Å∏ |
| **Cache** | Read-heavy operations | Twitter: Serve stale tweets¬π‚Åπ |
| **Queue** | Write operations | Uber: Queue ride requests¬≤‚Å∞ |
| **Degraded Service** | Partial functionality | Spotify: Offline playlists¬≤¬π |

#### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

```yaml
Key Metrics to Track:
- Circuit state changes
- Request volume when open
- Recovery success rate
- Fallback execution rate
- Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
```

**Industry Practice**: LinkedIn monitors¬≤¬≤:
- Circuit state transitions per minute
- Business impact when circuits open
- Time to recovery distribution
- Correlation with deployment events

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

| Pitfall | Consequence | Solution | Case Study |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Thundering Herd** | All instances test simultaneously | Jittered recovery timeout | Facebook: Random jitter prevents synchronized recovery¬≤¬≥ |
| **Too Sensitive** | Opens on minor blips | Require volume threshold | Google: Minimum 100 requests before evaluating¬≤‚Å¥ |
| **Too Slow to Open** | Cascading failures | Lower thresholds under load | Netflix: Adaptive thresholds based on system health¬≤‚Åµ |
| **No Fallback** | Complete feature loss | Implement degraded mode | Amazon: Read from cache when DynamoDB circuits open¬≤‚Å∂ |

---

## üöÄ Level 4: Expert

### Implementation Examples

#### 1. Language-Specific Libraries

| Language | Library | Features | Adoption |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Java** | Hystrix | Full featured, metrics | Netflix, Airbnb |
| **Go** | sony/gobreaker | Lightweight, simple | Uber, Grab |
| **Python** | py-breaker | Decorators, async | Instagram, Pinterest |
| **JavaScript** | opossum | Promise-based | PayPal, Walmart |
| **.NET** | Polly | Policy-based | Microsoft, Stack Overflow |

#### 2. Service Mesh Integration

Modern service meshes provide circuit breaking out of the box:

```yaml
# Istio DestinationRule
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  host: reviews
  trafficPolicy:
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 5
      interval: 30s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
```

**Production Usage**: 
- Lyft's Envoy¬≤‚Å∑: 10,000+ services protected
- Google Cloud Run¬≤‚Å∏: Automatic circuit breaking
- AWS App Mesh¬≤‚Åπ: Built-in outlier detection

### Testing Circuit Breakers

#### 1. Chaos Engineering

!!! example "Netflix's Approach"
    Netflix's Chaos Monkey¬≥‚Å∞ specifically tests circuit breakers by:
    - Injecting latency to trigger timeouts
    - Causing services to return errors
    - Simulating network partitions
    - Validating fallback behavior

#### 2. Load Testing Scenarios

```yaml
Test Scenarios:
1. Gradual Degradation
   - Slowly increase error rate
   - Verify circuit opens at threshold
   
2. Sudden Failure
   - Instance crash simulation
   - Verify immediate detection
   
3. Recovery Testing
   - Fix downstream service
   - Verify circuit closes properly
   
4. Partial Failure
   - 30% requests fail
   - Verify appropriate response
```

### Production Patterns

#### Netflix Hystrix Architecture

- **Protection Layers**: Circuit Breaker ‚Üí Thread Pool Isolation ‚Üí Fallback Method
- **Flow**: Request ‚Üí Check Circuit ‚Üí If closed: Try service ‚Üí Success/Failure
- **Fallback**: Circuit open or service failure ‚Üí Return cached/default response

#### Multi-Level Circuit Breakers

- **Application Level**: Global circuit breaker
- **Service Level**: Per-service circuit breakers (Service A, B, Database)
- **Instance Level**: Per-instance health tracking
- **Benefit**: Granular failure isolation - instance failure doesn't affect entire service

#### Distributed Circuit Breaker State

**Problem**: Individual instances have different views of service health

**Solution**: Shared circuit breaker state

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Redis Store** | Fast, consistent | Single point of failure |
| **Consensus** | Highly available | Complex, slow |
| **Gossip Protocol** | Decentralized | Eventually consistent |
| **Load Balancer** | Centralized control | Vendor lock-in |

### Advanced Failure Cases

#### Thundering Herd on Recovery
```text
Problem:
Circuit reopens ‚Üí All instances send traffic simultaneously

Solution: Gradual Recovery
Half-open: 10% traffic ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%
```

#### False Positives
```text
Cause: Temporary network glitch
Result: Circuit opens unnecessarily

Mitigation:
- Require sustained failures
- Different thresholds for different error types
- Jittered recovery times
```

#### Cascade Failures
```text
Service A calls Service B calls Service C

C fails ‚Üí B circuit opens ‚Üí A circuit opens

Result: Entire request path unusable

Mitigation:
- Different timeout values per layer
- Partial failure handling
- Graceful degradation
```

### Case Study: Uber

**Problem**: Maps service failures crashed rider app

**Solution**: Service-level circuit breakers with Redis shared state, cached map tile fallbacks, gradual recovery (5%‚Üí25%‚Üí100%)

**Results**: 99.9%‚Üí99.99% availability, 50% fewer errors, 30% faster recovery

## üìä Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Amazon Prime Day 2018

!!! success "Circuit Breakers Save Prime Day"
    During Prime Day 2018, Amazon's recommendation service experienced 10x normal load¬≥¬π. Circuit breakers:
    - Detected 500ms ‚Üí 5s latency increase
    - Opened circuits to recommendation service
    - Served cached "popular items" instead
    - **Result**: 0% checkout failures despite recommendation service struggling

### Case Study 2: GitHub's 2018 Outage

!!! failure "When Circuit Breakers Aren't Enough"
    During GitHub's October 2018 outage¬≥¬≤, circuit breakers couldn't help because:
    - Database split-brain affected writes
    - Reads appeared healthy (closed circuits)
    - Problem was correctness, not availability
    - **Lesson**: Circuit breakers protect availability, not consistency

### Case Study 3: Uber's Geospatial Service

!!! example "Graceful Degradation in Action"
    Uber's routing service uses circuit breakers with fallbacks¬≥¬≥:
    1. **Primary**: Real-time traffic routing
    2. **Fallback 1**: Historical traffic patterns
    3. **Fallback 2**: Distance-based routing
    4. **Result**: 99.99% ride completion even during Google Maps API outages

---

## üèÜ Best Practices

### 1. Start with Sensible Defaults

Based on analysis of 50+ production systems¬≥‚Å¥:

```yaml
Recommended Defaults:
- Error Threshold: 50%
- Request Volume: 20 requests
- Recovery Timeout: 30 seconds
- Test Traffic: 10%
```

### 2. Monitor Business Metrics

Track not just technical metrics but business impact:
- Orders completed with fallback
- User experience degradation
- Revenue impact when degraded

### 3. Test in Production

!!! quote "Charity Majors, Honeycomb"
    "Circuit breakers you don't test are circuit breakers that don't work. Test them weekly in production."¬≥‚Åµ

### 4. Document Fallback Behavior

Clear runbooks for when circuits open:
- What functionality is degraded?
- What alerts fire?
- What's the recovery process?
- Who gets paged?
