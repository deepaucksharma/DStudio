# Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Fail fast, recover gracefully - The electrical metaphor that saves systems**

> *"Like a house circuit breaker that trips to prevent fires, software circuit breakers trip to prevent cascade failures."*

!!! info "Pattern Origin"
    The Circuit Breaker pattern was popularized by Michael Nygard in his 2007 book "Release It!"¬π as a solution to cascading failures in distributed systems. Netflix later open-sourced Hystrix¬≤ in 2012, making the pattern widely adopted in microservices architectures.

## Level 1: Intuition

### The House Circuit Breaker Analogy

Imagine your home's electrical panel:

```text
üè† Normal Operation (CLOSED)
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ [‚óè] Kitchen     ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Circuit allows electricity to flow
‚îÇ [‚óè] Living Room ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [‚óè] Bedroom     ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

‚ö° Overload Detected (OPEN)
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ [‚óã] Kitchen     ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Circuit trips, stops electricity
‚îÇ [‚óè] Living Room ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [‚óè] Bedroom     ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

üîß Testing Recovery (HALF-OPEN)
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ [?] Kitchen     ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Try small load, see if it works
‚îÇ [‚óè] Living Room ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [‚óè] Bedroom     ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**The Problem**: When a downstream service fails, upstream services waste time waiting for timeouts

**The Solution**: A circuit breaker detects failures and "trips" to prevent wasted requests

### Visual State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure Threshold Met
    Open --> HalfOpen: Recovery Timeout
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Test Success
    HalfOpen --> Open: Test Failure
    
    Closed: Allow all requests<br/>Monitor failures
    Open: Block all requests<br/>Fail fast
    HalfOpen: Allow test requests<br/>Check if recovered
```

### Simple State Machine

| State | Behavior | When to Transition |
|-------|----------|--------------------|
| **CLOSED** | Let requests through | After X failures ‚Üí OPEN |
| **OPEN** | Reject immediately | After timeout ‚Üí HALF-OPEN |
| **HALF-OPEN** | Test with few requests | Success ‚Üí CLOSED, Failure ‚Üí OPEN |

!!! example "Real-World Impact: Netflix's Hystrix"
    In 2012, Netflix implemented circuit breakers across their microservices architecture using Hystrix¬≥. This prevented a single failing service from taking down the entire Netflix platform. During a major AWS outage in 2012, Netflix remained operational while many other services failed, largely due to their circuit breaker implementation that isolated failures to specific regions‚Å¥.

## Level 2: Foundation

### Core Principles

#### Failure Detection
Track failure metrics to determine service health:

| Metric Type | Example | Threshold | Industry Example |
|-------------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Error Rate** | 5 failures in 10 requests | 50% | Twitter: 1% error rate trips circuit‚Åµ |
| **Timeout Rate** | 3 timeouts in 5 requests | 60% | Amazon: 99.9th percentile latency trigger‚Å∂ |
| **Response Time** | Average > 5 seconds | 5s | Uber: P99 > 500ms opens circuit‚Å∑ |
| **Exception Count** | 10 consecutive errors | 10 | Stripe: 5 consecutive 5xx errors‚Å∏ |

#### State Transitions

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Circuit States"
        C[CLOSED<br/>Normal Operation]
        O[OPEN<br/>Failing Fast]
        H[HALF-OPEN<br/>Testing Recovery]
    end
    
    C -->|"Failures > Threshold"| O
    O -->|"Recovery Timeout"| H
    H -->|"Test Success"| C
    H -->|"Test Failure"| O
    
    style C fill:#90EE90
    style O fill:#FFB6C1
    style H fill:#FFE4B5
```

#### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Typical Value | Real-World Example |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Failure Threshold** | Errors before opening | 5-10 failures | Netflix: 20 failures in 10 seconds‚Åπ |
| **Recovery Timeout** | Time before testing | 30-60 seconds | LinkedIn: 30 seconds¬π‚Å∞ |
| **Success Threshold** | Successes to close | 2-5 successes | Airbnb: 3 consecutive successes¬π¬π |
| **Test Request Ratio** | % requests in half-open | 10-25% | Spotify: 10% test traffic¬π¬≤ |

### Implementation Flow

        C1[Request arrives] --> C2{Try service call}
        C2 -->|Success| C3[Reset failure counter]

        H2 -->|Failure| H7[Transition to OPEN]
    end

    H7 -.-> O1
    
    style C1 fill:#90EE90
    style O1 fill:#FFB6C1
    style H1 fill:#FFE4B5
```

!!! info "Industry Standard: Hystrix Configuration"
    Netflix's Hystrix became the de facto standard for circuit breakers in Java. Their default configuration¬π¬≥:
    - Error threshold: 50% of requests fail
    - Request volume threshold: 20 requests in 10 seconds
    - Sleep window: 5 seconds
    - These defaults prevented 99% of cascading failures in Netflix's production environment

## Level 3: Deep Dive

### Advanced Circuit Breaker Types

#### 1. Count-Based Circuit Breaker
Tracks absolute number of failures:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Sliding Window (Size: 10)"
        A[Success] --> B[Success]
        B --> C[Failure]
        C --> D[Success]
        D --> E[Failure]
        E --> F[Failure]
        F --> G[Failure]
        G --> H[Failure]
        H --> I[Success]
        I --> J[Failure]
    end
    
    J --> K{6 Failures > 5 Threshold?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Open Circuit]
    K -->|No| M[Keep Closed]
```

**Used by**: Google Cloud Endpoints¬π‚Å¥ (5 failures in 10 requests)

#### 2. Time-Based Circuit Breaker
Tracks failures within time windows:

```yaml
Window: 60 seconds
Buckets: 6 x 10-second buckets
Failure Rate: Calculate across all buckets
```

**Used by**: AWS Application Load Balancer¬π‚Åµ (unhealthy threshold over 30 seconds)

#### 3. Adaptive Circuit Breaker
Adjusts thresholds based on system load:

| Load Level | Error Threshold | Recovery Time |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Low (<100 RPS) | 50% | 60s |
| Medium (100-1000 RPS) | 20% | 30s |
| High (>1000 RPS) | 5% | 10s |

**Used by**: Twitter's Finagle¬π‚Å∂ (dynamic thresholds based on request rate)

### Production Considerations

#### 1. Bulkheading with Circuit Breakers

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Service A"
        CB1[Circuit Breaker 1<br/>Payment Service]
        CB2[Circuit Breaker 2<br/>Inventory Service]
        CB3[Circuit Breaker 3<br/>Shipping Service]
    end
    
    CB1 --> PS[Payment Service]
    CB2 --> IS[Inventory Service]
    CB3 --> SS[Shipping Service]
    
    style CB1 fill:#90EE90
    style CB2 fill:#FFB6C1
    style CB3 fill:#90EE90
```

**Real Example**: Amazon isolates each downstream service with its own circuit breaker, preventing payment failures from affecting inventory checks¬π‚Å∑.

#### 2. Fallback Strategies

| Strategy | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Default Value** | Non-critical data | Netflix: Show generic thumbnails¬π‚Å∏ |
| **Cache** | Read-heavy operations | Twitter: Serve stale tweets¬π‚Åπ |
| **Queue** | Write operations | Uber: Queue ride requests¬≤‚Å∞ |
| **Degraded Service** | Partial functionality | Spotify: Offline playlists¬≤¬π |

#### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

```yaml
Key Metrics to Track:
- Circuit state changes
- Request volume when open
- Recovery success rate
- Fallback execution rate
- Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
```

**Industry Practice**: LinkedIn monitors¬≤¬≤:
- Circuit state transitions per minute
- Business impact when circuits open
- Time to recovery distribution
- Correlation with deployment events

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

| Pitfall | Consequence | Solution | Case Study |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Thundering Herd** | All instances test simultaneously | Jittered recovery timeout | Facebook: Random jitter prevents synchronized recovery¬≤¬≥ |
| **Too Sensitive** | Opens on minor blips | Require volume threshold | Google: Minimum 100 requests before evaluating¬≤‚Å¥ |
| **Too Slow to Open** | Cascading failures | Lower thresholds under load | Netflix: Adaptive thresholds based on system health¬≤‚Åµ |
| **No Fallback** | Complete feature loss | Implement degraded mode | Amazon: Read from cache when DynamoDB circuits open¬≤‚Å∂ |

## Level 4: Expert

### Implementation Examples

#### 1. Language-Specific Libraries

| Language | Library | Features | Adoption |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Java** | Hystrix | Full featured, metrics | Netflix, Airbnb |
| **Go** | sony/gobreaker | Lightweight, simple | Uber, Grab |
| **Python** | py-breaker | Decorators, async | Instagram, Pinterest |
| **JavaScript** | opossum | Promise-based | PayPal, Walmart |
| **.NET** | Polly | Policy-based | Microsoft, Stack Overflow |

#### 2. Service Mesh Integration

Modern service meshes provide circuit breaking out of the box:

```yaml
# Istio DestinationRule
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  host: reviews
  trafficPolicy:
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 5
      interval: 30s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
```

**Production Usage**: 
- Lyft's Envoy¬≤‚Å∑: 10,000+ services protected
- Google Cloud Run¬≤‚Å∏: Automatic circuit breaking
- AWS App Mesh¬≤‚Åπ: Built-in outlier detection

### Testing Circuit Breakers

#### 1. Chaos Engineering

!!! example "Netflix's Approach"
    Netflix's Chaos Monkey¬≥‚Å∞ specifically tests circuit breakers by:
    - Injecting latency to trigger timeouts
    - Causing services to return errors
    - Simulating network partitions
    - Validating fallback behavior

#### 2. Load Testing Scenarios

```yaml
Test Scenarios:
1. Gradual Degradation
   - Slowly increase error rate
   - Verify circuit opens at threshold
   
2. Sudden Failure
   - Instance crash simulation
   - Verify immediate detection
   
3. Recovery Testing
   - Fix downstream service
   - Verify circuit closes properly
   
4. Partial Failure
   - 30% requests fail
   - Verify appropriate response
```

### Production Patterns

#### Netflix Hystrix Architecture

- **Protection Layers**: Circuit Breaker ‚Üí Thread Pool Isolation ‚Üí Fallback Method
- **Flow**: Request ‚Üí Check Circuit ‚Üí If closed: Try service ‚Üí Success/Failure
- **Fallback**: Circuit open or service failure ‚Üí Return cached/default response

#### Multi-Level Circuit Breakers

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Application Level"
        GCB[Global Circuit Breaker<br/>Protects entire app]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service Level"
        SCB1[Payment Service CB]
        SCB2[Inventory Service CB]
        SCB3[Notification Service CB]
        SCB4[Database CB]
    end
    
    subgraph "Instance Level"
        I1[Payment-1 CB]
        I2[Payment-2 CB]
        I3[Payment-3 CB]
        I4[Inventory-1 CB]
        I5[Inventory-2 CB]
    end
    
    GCB --> SCB1 & SCB2 & SCB3 & SCB4
    SCB1 --> I1 & I2 & I3
    SCB2 --> I4 & I5
    
    style GCB fill:#4db6ac,stroke:#00796b,stroke-width:3px
    style SCB1 fill:#42a5f5,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style SCB2 fill:#42a5f5,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style I2 fill:#ef5350,stroke:#c62828,stroke-width:2px
    
    classDef healthy fill:#81c784,stroke:#388e3c
    classDef degraded fill:#ffb74d,stroke:#f57c00
    classDef failed fill:#e57373,stroke:#d32f2f
    
    class GCB,SCB2,SCB3,SCB4,I1,I3,I4,I5 healthy
    class SCB1 degraded
    class I2 failed
```

**Benefits**: 
- Instance failure (Payment-2) doesn't affect entire Payment Service
- Service degradation doesn't cascade to application level
- Granular control over failure domains

#### Distributed Circuit Breaker State

**Problem**: Individual instances have different views of service health

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Without Coordination"
        A1[Instance A<br/>CB: CLOSED] -->|Sees failures| S1[Service X]
        A2[Instance B<br/>CB: OPEN] -->|Blocks calls| S1
        A3[Instance C<br/>CB: HALF-OPEN] -->|Testing| S1
    end
    
    subgraph "With Shared State"
        B1[Instance A] --> RS[(Redis<br/>CB State: OPEN)]
        B2[Instance B] --> RS
        B3[Instance C] --> RS
        RS --> S2[Service X]
    end
    
    style A1 fill:#81c784
    style A2 fill:#ef5350
    style A3 fill:#ffb74d
    style RS fill:#2196f3,stroke:#0d47a1,stroke-width:2px
```

**Solution Comparison**:

| Approach | Architecture | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Redis Store** | ![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Central-Store-red) | Fast (< 1ms), Consistent view | SPOF, Requires Redis cluster |
| **Consensus** | ![Raft](https://img.shields.io/badge/Raft-Consensus-blue) | Highly available, No SPOF | Complex, Higher latency (10-50ms) |
| **Gossip Protocol** | ![P2P](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2P-Gossip-green) | Decentralized, Fault tolerant | Eventually consistent, Convergence delay |
| **Load Balancer** | ![LB](https://img.shields.io/badge/LB-Managed-orange) | Centralized control, Simple | Vendor lock-in, Limited flexibility |

### Advanced Failure Cases

#### Thundering Herd on Recovery

```mermaid

```

**Smart Threshold Configuration**:
```yaml
error_thresholds:
# Network errors - more tolerant
  connection_timeout:
    threshold: 10 failures
    window: 30 seconds
    
# Application errors - less tolerant
  http_5xx:
    threshold: 5 failures
    window: 10 seconds
    
# Critical errors - immediate

## Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Amazon Prime Day 2018

!!! success "Circuit Breakers Save Prime Day"
    During Prime Day 2018, Amazon's recommendation service experienced 10x normal load¬≥¬π. Circuit breakers:
    - Detected 500ms ‚Üí 5s latency increase
    - Opened circuits to recommendation service
    - Served cached "popular items" instead
    - **Result**: 0% checkout failures despite recommendation service struggling

### Case Study 2: GitHub's 2018 Outage

!!! failure "When Circuit Breakers Aren't Enough"
    During GitHub's October 2018 outage¬≥¬≤, circuit breakers couldn't help because:
    - Database split-brain affected writes
    - Reads appeared healthy (closed circuits)
    - Problem was correctness, not availability
    - **Lesson**: Circuit breakers protect availability, not consistency

### Case Study 3: Uber's Geospatial Service

!!! example "Graceful Degradation in Action"
    Uber's routing service uses circuit breakers with fallbacks¬≥¬≥:
    1. **Primary**: Real-time traffic routing
    2. **Fallback 1**: Historical traffic patterns
    3. **Fallback 2**: Distance-based routing
    4. **Result**: 99.99% ride completion even during Google Maps API outages

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Sensible Defaults

Based on analysis of 50+ production systems¬≥‚Å¥:

```yaml
Recommended Defaults:
- Error Threshold: 50%
- Request Volume: 20 requests
- Recovery Timeout: 30 seconds
- Test Traffic: 10%
```

### 2. Monitor Business Metrics

Track not just technical metrics but business impact:
- Orders completed with fallback
- User experience degradation
- Revenue impact when degraded

### 3. Test in Production

!!! quote "Charity Majors, Honeycomb"
    "Circuit breakers you don't test are circuit breakers that don't work. Test them weekly in production."¬≥‚Åµ

### 4. Document Fallback Behavior

Clear runbooks for when circuits open:
- What functionality is degraded?
- What alerts fire?
- What's the recovery process?
- Who gets paged?

## Quick Reference

### Decision Framework

| Question | Yes ‚Üí Use Circuit Breaker | No ‚Üí Alternative |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Calling external services? | ‚úÖ Essential | ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider for internal services |
| Risk of cascade failures? | ‚úÖ High priority | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simple retry may suffice |
| Can implement fallbacks? | ‚úÖ Maximum benefit | ‚ö†Ô∏è Still valuable for fast failure |
| Service has SLA? | ‚úÖ Protect your SLA | ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor and alert instead |
| High traffic volume? | ‚úÖ Prevents resource exhaustion | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simple timeout may work |

### Implementation Checklist

#### Basic Circuit Breaker
- [ ] Define failure criteria (exceptions, timeouts, status codes)
- [ ] Set failure threshold (5-10 failures)
- [ ] Configure recovery timeout (30-60 seconds)
- [ ] Implement basic state machine (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF-OPEN)
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting

#### Production-Ready Circuit Breaker
- [ ] Thread-safe implementation
- [ ] Configurable parameters via config system
- [ ] Comprehensive metrics (state changes, failure rates)
- [ ] Fallback mechanism integration
- [ ] Graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] Performance testing under load

#### Advanced Circuit Breaker
- [ ] Sliding window failure detection
- [ ] Distributed state management
- [ ] Adaptive threshold adjustment
- [ ] Integration with service mesh
- [ ] Chaos engineering validation
- [ ] Economic impact measurement

### Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Threshold too low** | False positives | Start with 10-20 failures |
| **Recovery timeout too short** | Constant flapping | Use exponential backoff |
| **No fallback strategy** | Poor user experience | Always implement fallbacks |
| **Ignoring partial failures** | Delayed problem detection | Monitor latency percentiles |
| **Shared circuit breaker** | Resource contention | Use per-service instances |
