title: Anti-Entropy Pattern
description: Repair divergent data across distributed nodes through systematic comparison and synchronization
type: pattern
category: distributed-data
difficulty: intermediate
reading_time: 30 min
prerequisites: [distributed-systems, eventual-consistency, merkle-trees, gossip-protocols]
when_to_use: Eventually consistent systems, multi-master replication, distributed databases, file synchronization, blockchain networks, healing after network partitions
when_not_to_use: Strongly consistent systems, real-time synchronization needs, small datasets, high network costs, when immediate consistency is required
