# Cell-Based Architecture Pattern

**Isolate failures and scale independently with cellular architecture**

> *This pattern is currently under development. Content will be added soon.*

## Overview

Cell-based architecture divides a system into multiple isolated cells, each capable of serving a subset of users independently. This pattern provides fault isolation, independent scaling, and simplified operations.

## Key Concepts

- **Cell**: Self-contained unit with all necessary components
- **Cell Router**: Directs users to appropriate cells
- **Isolation**: Cells don't share state or dependencies
- **Blast Radius**: Failures limited to single cell

## Common Use Cases

- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
- Geographic distribution
- Compliance boundaries
- Failure isolation
