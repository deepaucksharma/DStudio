## ⚠️ Pattern Under Construction

This pattern documentation is currently being developed. Multi-Region Architecture involves deploying and operating applications across multiple geographic regions to achieve global scale, improved performance, and disaster recovery capabilities.

### Coming Soon

- **Architecture Patterns**: Active-active, active-passive, pilot light
- **Data Strategies**: Multi-master replication, conflict resolution, consistency models
- **Traffic Management**: Global load balancing, geo-routing, failover strategies
- **Cost Optimization**: Regional resource allocation, data transfer costs
- **Compliance Considerations**: Data sovereignty, regional regulations
- **Real-World Examples**: Netflix, Spotify, and Uber's global architectures

### Quick Overview

Multi-Region Architecture enables:

1. **Global Performance**: Serve users from nearby regions
2. **High Availability**: Survive entire region failures
3. **Compliance**: Meet data residency requirements
4. **Scalability**: Distribute load across regions

### Key Patterns

- **Active-Active**: All regions serve traffic simultaneously
- **Active-Passive**: Primary region with standby regions
- **Follow-the-Sun**: Shift capacity based on time zones
- **Data Locality**: Keep data close to users

### Key Challenges

- Data consistency across regions
- Complex deployment and testing
- Increased operational overhead
- Higher infrastructure costs
- Network partitioning between regions
