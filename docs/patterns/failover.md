# Failover Pattern

**Seamless switching to backup systems when primary fails**

> *This pattern is currently under development. Content will be added soon.*

## Overview

The Failover pattern ensures system availability by automatically switching to a backup system when the primary system fails. This pattern is crucial for high-availability systems.

## Types of Failover

### Active-Passive Failover
- Primary handles all traffic
- Standby remains idle
- Switches on primary failure

### Active-Active Failover
- Both systems handle traffic
- Load distributed between them
- Either can take full load

### Pilot Light
- Minimal standby environment
- Scaled up when needed
- Cost-effective for DR

## Key Components

- **Health Monitoring**: Detect failures quickly
- **State Synchronization**: Keep backup current
- **Traffic Switching**: Redirect users seamlessly
- **Rollback Capability**: Return to primary when fixed

## Common Use Cases

- Database high availability
- Multi-region deployments
- Disaster recovery
- Zero-downtime deployments
