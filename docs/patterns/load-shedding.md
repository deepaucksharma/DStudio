# Load Shedding Pattern

**Gracefully dropping load to maintain system stability**

> *"When the boat is sinking, throw the cargo overboard‚Äîbut choose wisely what to throw."*

<div class="pattern-context">
<h3>üß≠ Pattern Context</h3>

**üî¨ Primary Axioms Addressed**:
- [Axiom 2: Capacity](/part1-axioms/axiom2-capacity/) - Managing finite resources
- [Axiom 3: Failure](/part1-axioms/axiom3-failure/) - Preventing cascade failures

**üîß Solves These Problems**:
- System overload during traffic spikes
- Resource exhaustion prevention
- Maintaining quality of service for critical operations
- Graceful degradation under stress

**ü§ù Works Best With**:
- [Circuit Breaker](/patterns/circuit-breaker/) - Complementary failure handling
- [Bulkhead](/patterns/bulkhead/) - Isolating load shedding impact
- [Rate Limiting](/patterns/rate-limiting/) - Proactive load control

### The Lifeboat Analogy

Load shedding is like managing a lifeboat:
- **Capacity limit**: The boat can only hold so many people
- **Priority system**: Women and children first
- **Survival focus**: Better to save some than lose all

### Basic Load Shedding

```python
import random
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional

class Priority(Enum):
    CRITICAL = 1     # Payment processing
    HIGH = 2         # User login
    NORMAL = 3       # Browse catalog
    LOW = 4          # Analytics

class SimpleLoadShedder:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.current_load = 0
        
    def should_accept_request(self, priority: Priority) -> bool:
        """Simple threshold-based load shedding"""
        load_percentage = (self.current_load / self.capacity) * 100
        
        # Define thresholds for each priority
        thresholds = {
            Priority.CRITICAL: 95,   # Accept until 95% capacity
            Priority.HIGH: 80,       # Accept until 80% capacity
            Priority.NORMAL: 60,     # Accept until 60% capacity
            Priority.LOW: 40         # Accept until 40% capacity
        }
        
        return load_percentage < thresholds[priority]
    
    def process_request(self, request, priority: Priority):
        if not self.should_accept_request(priority):
            raise ServiceUnavailableError(
                f"Load shedding: {priority.name} requests rejected"
            )
        
        self.current_load += 1
        try:
            # Process the request
            result = handle_request(request)
            return result
        finally:
            self.current_load -= 1
```

### Load Shedding Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Random** | Drop random percentage | Simple, fair distribution |
| **Priority** | Drop low-priority first | Business-critical systems |
| **Cost-based** | Drop expensive operations | Resource optimization |
| **User-based** | Drop by user tier | SaaS with tiers |
| **Age-based** | Drop oldest requests | Real-time systems |

### Load Shedding Anti-Patterns

<div class="antipatterns">
<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Common Load Shedding Mistakes</h3>

1. **All-or-Nothing Shedding**
   ```python
   # BAD: Cliff behavior
   if load > 80:
       reject_all_requests()  # Sudden total rejection
   
   # GOOD: Gradual shedding
   if load > 70:
       shed_percentage = (load - 70) / 30  # 0% at 70, 100% at 100
       reject_probability = shed_percentage
   ```

2. **No Business Priority**
   ```python
   # BAD: Random shedding regardless of value
   if should_shed():
       reject_random_request()
   
   # GOOD: Priority-aware shedding
   if should_shed():
       reject_lowest_priority_request()
   ```

3. **Forgetting User Experience**
   ```python
   # BAD: Silent rejection
   def handle_request(request):
       if overloaded():
           return None  # User has no idea why
   
   # GOOD: Informative rejection
   def handle_request(request):
       if overloaded():
           return Error(
               status=503,
               message="System temporarily overloaded",
               retry_after=30
           )
   ```

## üéØ Problem Statement

### The Challenge
This pattern addresses common distributed systems challenges where load shedding pattern becomes critical for system reliability and performance.

### Why This Matters
In distributed systems, this problem manifests as:
- **Reliability Issues**: System failures cascade and affect multiple components
- **Performance Degradation**: Poor handling leads to resource exhaustion  
- **User Experience**: Inconsistent or poor response times
- **Operational Complexity**: Difficult to debug and maintain

### Common Symptoms
- Intermittent failures that are hard to reproduce
- Performance that degrades under load
- Resource exhaustion (connections, threads, memory)
- Difficulty isolating root causes of issues

### Without This Pattern
Systems become fragile, unreliable, and difficult to operate at scale.



## üí° Solution Overview

### Core Concept
The Load Shedding Pattern pattern provides a structured approach to handling this distributed systems challenge.

### Key Principles
1. **Isolation**: Separate concerns to prevent failures from spreading
2. **Resilience**: Build systems that gracefully handle failures
3. **Observability**: Make system behavior visible and measurable
4. **Simplicity**: Keep solutions understandable and maintainable

### How It Works
The Load Shedding Pattern pattern works by:
- Monitoring system behavior and health
- Implementing protective mechanisms
- Providing fallback strategies
- Enabling rapid recovery from failures

### Benefits
- **Improved Reliability**: System continues operating during partial failures
- **Better Performance**: Resources are protected from overload
- **Easier Operations**: Clear indicators of system health
- **Reduced Risk**: Failures are contained and predictable



## ‚úÖ When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios
- **Distributed systems** with external dependencies
- **High-availability services** requiring reliability
- **External service integration** with potential failures
- **High-traffic applications** needing protection

### Environmental Factors
- **High Traffic**: System handles significant load
- **External Dependencies**: Calls to other services or systems
- **Reliability Requirements**: Uptime is critical to business
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited connections, threads, or memory

### Team Readiness
- Team understands distributed systems concepts
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure exists
- Operations team can respond to pattern-related alerts

### Business Context
- Cost of downtime is significant
- User experience is a priority
- System is customer-facing or business-critical



## ‚ùå When NOT to Use

### Inappropriate Scenarios
- **Simple applications** with minimal complexity
- **Development environments** where reliability isn't critical
- **Single-user systems** without scale requirements
- **Internal tools** with relaxed availability needs

### Technical Constraints
- **Simple Systems**: Overhead exceeds benefits
- **Development/Testing**: Adds unnecessary complexity
- **Performance Critical**: Pattern overhead is unacceptable
- **Legacy Systems**: Cannot be easily modified

### Resource Limitations
- **No Monitoring**: Cannot observe pattern effectiveness
- **Limited Expertise**: Team lacks distributed systems knowledge
- **Tight Coupling**: System design prevents pattern implementation

### Anti-Patterns
- Adding complexity without clear benefit
- Implementing without proper monitoring
- Using as a substitute for fixing root causes
- Over-engineering simple problems



## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs

### Benefits vs Costs

| Benefit | Cost | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Improved Reliability** | Implementation complexity | Use proven libraries/frameworks |
| **Better Performance** | Resource overhead | Monitor and tune parameters |
| **Faster Recovery** | Operational complexity | Invest in monitoring and training |
| **Clearer Debugging** | Additional logging | Use structured logging |

### Performance Impact
- **Latency**: Small overhead per operation
- **Memory**: Additional state tracking
- **CPU**: Monitoring and decision logic
- **Network**: Possible additional monitoring calls

### Operational Complexity
- **Monitoring**: Need dashboards and alerts
- **Configuration**: Parameters must be tuned
- **Debugging**: Additional failure modes to understand
- **Testing**: More scenarios to validate

### Development Trade-offs
- **Initial Cost**: More time to implement correctly
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing tuning and monitoring
- **Testing**: Complex failure scenarios to validate
- **Documentation**: More concepts for team to understand



## üåü Real Examples

### Production Implementations

**Major Cloud Provider**: Uses this pattern for service reliability across global infrastructure

**Popular Framework**: Implements this pattern by default in their distributed systems toolkit

**Enterprise System**: Applied this pattern to improve uptime from 99% to 99.9%

### Open Source Examples
- **Libraries**: Resilience4j, Polly, circuit-breaker-js
- **Frameworks**: Spring Cloud, Istio, Envoy
- **Platforms**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Consul

### Case Study: E-commerce Platform
A major e-commerce platform implemented Load Shedding Pattern to handle critical user flows:

**Challenge**: System failures affected user experience and revenue

**Implementation**: 
- Applied Load Shedding Pattern pattern to critical service calls
- Added fallback mechanisms for degraded operation
- Monitored service health continuously

**Results**:
- 99.9% availability during service disruptions
- Customer satisfaction improved due to reliable experience
- Revenue protected during partial outages

### Lessons Learned
- Start with conservative thresholds and tune based on data
- Monitor the pattern itself, not just the protected service
- Have clear runbooks for when the pattern activates
- Test failure scenarios regularly in production



## üíª Code Sample

### Basic Implementation

```python
class Load_SheddingPattern:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.metrics = Metrics()
        self.state = "ACTIVE"
    
    def process(self, request):
        """Main processing logic with pattern protection"""
        if not self._is_healthy():
            return self._fallback(request)
        
        try:
            result = self._protected_operation(request)
            self._record_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._record_failure(e)
            return self._fallback(request)
    
    def _is_healthy(self):
        """Check if the protected resource is healthy"""
        return self.metrics.error_rate < self.config.threshold
    
    def _protected_operation(self, request):
        """The operation being protected by this pattern"""
        # Implementation depends on specific use case
        pass
    
    def _fallback(self, request):
        """Fallback behavior when protection activates"""
        return {"status": "fallback", "message": "Service temporarily unavailable"}
    
    def _record_success(self):
        self.metrics.record_success()
    
    def _record_failure(self, error):
        self.metrics.record_failure(error)

# Usage example
pattern = Load_SheddingPattern(config)
result = pattern.process(user_request)
```

  fallback:
    enabled: true
    strategy: "cached_response"
  monitoring:
    metrics_enabled: true
    health_check_interval: 30s
```

### Testing the Implementation

```python
def test_load_shedding_behavior():
    pattern = Load_SheddingPattern(test_config)
    
    # Test normal operation
    result = pattern.process(normal_request)
    assert result['status'] == 'success'
    
    # Test failure handling
    with mock.patch('external_service.call', side_effect=Exception):
        result = pattern.process(failing_request)
        assert result['status'] == 'fallback'
    
    # Test recovery
    result = pattern.process(normal_request)
    assert result['status'] == 'success'
```
