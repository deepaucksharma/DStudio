3. **Deprecate/Archive Bronze Patterns**:
   - Move educational patterns (cap-theorem.md) to theory section
   - Archive overly generic patterns
   - Consolidate redundant patterns

### Pattern Organization
1. **Create Pattern Packs**:
   - Resilience Pack: circuit-breaker, retry-backoff, timeout, health-check
   - Data Pack: sharding, cqrs, event-sourcing, cdc
   - Scale Pack: load-balancing, auto-scaling, caching, cdn
   - Coordination Pack: leader-election, distributed-lock, consensus

2. **Add Decision Trees**:
   - When to use each pattern
   - Pattern selection based on scale
   - Migration paths between patterns

3. **Enhance Gold Pattern Documentation**:
   - Add more company case studies
   - Include performance benchmarks
   - Provide implementation templates

## Conclusion

This classification provides a clear hierarchy for the DStudio pattern collection. The Gold patterns represent battle-tested, essential solutions that every distributed systems engineer should master. Silver patterns offer valuable solutions for specific contexts, while Bronze patterns serve primarily educational purposes or represent outdated approaches.

By restoring the identified patterns from the archive and reorganizing based on this classification, DStudio will provide clearer guidance for engineers building distributed systems at any scale.
