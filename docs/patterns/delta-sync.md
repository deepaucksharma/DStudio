# Delta Sync Pattern

!!! warning "ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Bandwidth-Efficient but Complex** â€¢ Use when sync efficiency matters
    
    Delta sync saves bandwidth by transmitting only changes, but requires sophisticated change tracking and conflict resolution. Consider full sync for smaller datasets or simpler requirements.

**Send only what changed, not everything**

## Visual Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client State"
        C1[Version 1<br/>A B C]
        C2[Version 2<br/>A B' C D]
        CD[Delta<br/>Bâ†’B', +D]
    end
    
    subgraph "Server State"
        S1[Version 1<br/>A B C]
        S2[Version 2<br/>A B' C D]
    end
    
    subgraph "Sync Process"
        Track[Track Changes]
        Compute[Compute Delta]
        Send[Send Delta Only]
        Apply[Apply Changes]
    end
    
    C1 --> Track
    Track --> C2
    C2 --> Compute
    Compute --> CD
    CD --> Send

## Delta Sync vs Full Sync

| Aspect | Delta Sync | Full Sync |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Data Sent** | Only changes | Entire dataset |
| **Bandwidth** | Low (KB-MB) | High (GB+) |
| **Complexity** | High | Low |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Required | Replace all |
| **State Tracking** | Required | Not needed |
| **Best For** | Large datasets | Small datasets |

## Implementation Strategies

graph LR
    subgraph "Change Detection Methods"
        MD[Modified Date]
        CS[Checksums]
        VV[Version Vectors]
        OT[Operational Transform]
    end

        LS[Line-based Diff]
        BL[Block-level]
        FL[Field-level]
    end
    
    MD --> BS
    CS --> BL
    VV --> FL
    OT --> LS
    
    style VV fill:#87CEEB
    style FL fill:#90EE90
```

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>ðŸŽ¯ Choosing Conflict Resolution</h4>

```mermaid
graph TD
    Conflict[Conflict Detected] --> Type{Conflict Type?}
    
    Type -->|Simple Value| LWW[Last-Write-Wins]
    Type -->|Additive| Merge[Merge Changes]
    Type -->|Complex| Manual[User Resolution]

```
</div>

## Common Implementation Patterns

### 1. Version Vector Approach

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Storage
    
    Note over Client,Server: Initial State: v1
    
    Client->>Client: Modify data
    Client->>Client: v1 â†’ v2
    Client->>Server: Send delta(v1â†’v2)
    
    Server->>Storage: Check current version
    Storage-->>Server: Current: v1
    Server->>Server: Apply delta
    Server->>Storage: Store v2
    Server-->>Client: ACK v2
    
    Note over Client,Server: Both at v2
```

### 2. Operational Transform (OT)

| Operation | Client A | Client B | Result After OT |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Insert "X" at 0 | "X" + "ABC" | "ABC" + "Y" | "XABCY" |
| Delete at 1 | "A_C" | "AB_" | "A_" |
| Replace at 0 | "X" replaces "A" | "Y" at end | "XBC" + "Y" |

## Performance Comparison

<div class="axiom-box">
<h4>ðŸ“Š Real-World Performance Gains</h4>

| Scenario | Full Sync | Delta Sync | Improvement |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 1GB file, 1MB change | 1GB transfer | 1MB transfer | 99.9% reduction |
| 1M records, 100 changed | 50MB transfer | 50KB transfer | 99.9% reduction |
| Mobile app daily sync | 10MB | 100KB | 99% reduction |
| Database replication | 1TB/day | 10GB/day | 99% reduction |

**Dropbox Case Study**: Average file has 4MB, average change is 40KB = 99% bandwidth saved
</div>

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Choose change tracking method (timestamp, checksum, version)
- [ ] Implement delta computation algorithm
- [ ] Design conflict detection mechanism
- [ ] Build conflict resolution strategy
- [ ] Add compression for delta payload
- [ ] Handle offline queue for changes
- [ ] Implement retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Monitor sync lag and conflicts
- [ ] Test with concurrent modifications
- [ ] Plan for full sync fallback

## Common Pitfalls

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>ðŸ’¥ The Phantom Conflict Problem</h4>

**What Happened**: Two users edit different parts of same document
**Problem**: System detects false conflict due to coarse tracking
**Result**: Users forced to manually resolve non-existent conflicts
**Solution**: Field-level or character-level change tracking
</div>

## When to Use Full Sync Instead
