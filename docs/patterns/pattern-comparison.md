### Synergy Explanations

#### ✅ Excellent Combinations

**CQRS + Event Sourcing**
- Event Sourcing provides the write model
- CQRS creates optimized read models from events
- Natural fit for audit trails and temporal queries

**Saga + Event Sourcing**
- Each saga step creates events
- Event log provides complete transaction history
- Easy compensation with event reversal

**Service Mesh + Rate Limiting**
- Mesh provides centralized rate limiting
- No code changes needed in services
- Consistent policy enforcement

#### Good Combinations

**CQRS + Sharding**
- Shard write model by aggregate
- Read models can be sharded differently
- Optimize for different access patterns

**Caching + Sharding**
- Cache frequently accessed shards locally
- Reduce cross-shard queries
- Improve read performance

#### ⚠ Complex Combinations

**Event Sourcing + Caching**
- Events are immutable, good for caching
- But cache invalidation is complex
- Need careful versioning strategy

**Saga + Caching**
- Cached data might be stale during saga
- Can cause incorrect decisions
- Need to bypass cache for saga operations
