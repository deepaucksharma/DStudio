## ⚠️ Pattern Under Construction

This pattern documentation is currently being developed. The Backpressure pattern is a flow control mechanism that allows systems to gracefully handle load by signaling when they're overwhelmed and need upstream producers to slow down.

### Coming Soon

- **Core Concepts**: Push vs pull models, flow control strategies
- **Implementation Techniques**: Reactive streams, bounded queues, credits/tokens
- **Signaling Mechanisms**: Explicit protocols, TCP flow control, HTTP status codes
- **Handling Strategies**: Buffering, dropping, sampling, throttling
- **Integration Patterns**: With message queues, stream processors, microservices
- **Real-World Examples**: Kafka consumer lag, Reactive Streams, TCP congestion control

### Quick Overview

Backpressure provides flow control through:

1. **Signal Propagation**: Downstream components signal capacity to upstream
2. **Flow Adjustment**: Producers adapt their rate based on consumer capacity
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System maintains stability under load
4. **Resource Protection**: Prevents memory exhaustion and cascade failures

### Key Strategies

- **Bounded Buffers**: Limit queue sizes to create natural backpressure
- **Credit-Based**: Consumers grant credits for messages they can handle
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle producers when consumers fall behind
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Dynamic adjustment based on system metrics

### Key Benefits

- Prevents system overload and crashes
- Maintains predictable performance
- Enables graceful degradation
- Protects slow consumers

### Key Challenges

- Complexity of implementation
- Latency in feedback loops
- Coordination across distributed systems
- Balancing throughput and responsiveness
