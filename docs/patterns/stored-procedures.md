# Stored Procedures Pattern

!!! danger "ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Legacy Pattern** â€¢ Consider modern alternatives
    
    While still in use in legacy systems, this pattern has been superseded by application-layer business logic and microservices. See migration guides for transitioning to modern approaches.

**When your database becomes your application server**

## Visual Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Traditional Stored Procedure Architecture"
        Client[Client App]
        SP1[SP: CreateOrder]
        SP2[SP: UpdateInventory]
        SP3[SP: CalculatePrice]
        SP4[SP: SendEmail]
        DB[(Database)]
        
        Client --> SP1
        SP1 --> SP2
        SP2 --> SP3
        SP3 --> SP4
        SP1 --> DB
        SP2 --> DB
        SP3 --> DB
        
        style SP1 fill:#FF6B6B
        style SP2 fill:#FF6B6B
        style SP3 fill:#FF6B6B
        style SP4 fill:#FF6B6B
    end
```

## Why Stored Procedures Are Problematic

| Problem | Impact | Modern Solution |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Can't change databases | Portable application code |
| **Poor Testing** | No unit test frameworks | TDD with mock objects |
| **Version Control** | Database scripts chaos | Git with CI/CD |
| **No Debugging** | Limited tools | Modern IDEs and debuggers |
| **Scaling Issues** | Vertical only | Horizontal microservices |
| **Mixed Concerns** | Business logic in DB | Clean architecture |

## Evolution of Business Logic Placement

## Common Anti-Patterns with Stored Procedures

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>ðŸ’¥ The 5000-Line Stored Procedure</h4>

**What Happens**: 
- Started as simple data validation
- Grew to include business rules
- Added email sending
- Now calls web services
- Contains embedded HTML

**Result**: Unmaintainable, untestable nightmare

**Prevention**: Keep stored procedures data-focused only
</div>

## When Stored Procedures Might Be Acceptable

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>ðŸŽ¯ Limited Acceptable Use Cases</h4>

1. **Data-Intensive Operations**
   - Bulk ETL processes
   - Complex reporting queries
   - Data warehouse operations

2. **Performance-Critical Paths**
   - High-frequency trading
   - Real-time analytics
   - Where network latency matters

3. **Security Boundaries**
   - Database-level access control
   - Audit logging at DB level

**Rule**: Only data manipulation, never business logic
</div>

## Migration Strategy from Stored Procedures

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[Stored Procedure<br/>System] --> Analyze[Analyze SP<br/>Dependencies]
    
    Analyze --> Extract[Extract Business<br/>Logic to Services]
    
    Extract --> Test[Create Unit<br/>Tests]
    
    Test --> Facade[Create Service<br/>Facade]
    
    Facade --> Switch[Switch Clients<br/>to API]
    
    Switch --> Remove[Remove Stored<br/>Procedures]
    
    style Start fill:#FF6B6B
    style Remove fill:#90EE90
```

## Modern Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Stored Procedures | Application Services | Serverless Functions |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Scalability** | Vertical only | Horizontal | Infinite |
| **Testing** | Database required | Mocked/In-memory | Local emulation |
| **Version Control** | Complex | Git native | Git native |
| **Debugging** | Limited tools | Full IDE support | Cloud debugging |
| **Deployment** | Database downtime | Rolling updates | Instant |
| **Cost Model** | License-based | Instance-based | Per-execution |

## Stored Procedure Code Smells

- [ ] Business logic mixed with data access
- [ ] Calling external services from SP
- [ ] HTML/XML generation in procedures
- [ ] Complex IF/ELSE business rules
- [ ] Cross-database queries
- [ ] Cursor-based processing
- [ ] Dynamic SQL generation
- [ ] Error handling via return codes

## Extracting Business Logic Example

### Before (Stored Procedure):
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE CalculateOrderDiscount
    @OrderID INT,
    @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    -- 500 lines of complex business rules
    -- Customer tier logic
    -- Seasonal promotions
    -- Product category rules
    -- Loyalty calculations
END
```

### After (Service):
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Microservices"
        OS[Order Service]
        DS[Discount Service]
        CS[Customer Service]
        PS[Promotion Service]
    end
    
    OS --> DS
    DS --> CS
    DS --> PS
    
    style DS fill:#90EE90
```

## Performance Myths vs Reality

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>ðŸ’¡ "But Stored Procedures Are Faster!"</h4>

**The Myth**: SPs are always faster than application code

**The Reality**:
- Network round trips often negligible
- Application servers scale horizontally
- Caching layers eliminate DB hits
- Modern ORMs optimize queries
- Database becomes bottleneck at scale

**Benchmark**: Netflix processes 1M+ requests/sec without stored procedures
