## ⚠️ Pattern Under Construction

This pattern documentation is currently being developed. The API Gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests to a microservices architecture, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request routing.

### Coming Soon

- **Core Responsibilities**: Request routing, protocol translation, aggregation
- **Implementation Patterns**: BFF (Backend for Frontend), GraphQL gateways
- **Security Features**: Authentication, authorization, API key management
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, response aggregation, circuit breaking
- **Operational Concerns**: Monitoring, rate limiting, versioning
- **Real-World Examples**: Netflix Zuul, Kong, AWS API Gateway

### Quick Overview

An API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy that:

1. **Routes Requests**: Directs incoming requests to appropriate microservices
2. **Handles Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Authentication, logging, rate limiting
3. **Transforms Requests/Responses**: Protocol translation, response aggregation
4. **Provides Client-Specific APIs**: Different APIs for web, mobile, partners

### Key Benefits

- Single entry point simplifies client communication
- Centralized security and policy enforcement
- Reduced chattiness through request aggregation
- API versioning and backward compatibility

### Key Challenges

- Can become a bottleneck
- Single point of failure
- Increased latency from additional hop
- Complexity of gateway logic
