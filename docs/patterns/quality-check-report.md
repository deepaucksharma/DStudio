## Remaining Gaps Analysis

### Patterns Without Visual Enhancement (108 files)
Based on the analysis, there are still 108 pattern files that lack visual elements. These fall into several categories:

#### Critical Patterns Needing Enhancement
1. **Consensus** - Complex topic needing visual representation
2. **Distributed Lock** - State diagrams would help
3. **Leader Election** - Process flow visualization needed
4. **CAP Theorem** - Classic visualization opportunity
5. **CRDT** - Type comparison tables needed

#### Specialized Patterns
- Geo-related: geohashing, geo-replication, geofencing
- Data patterns: data lake, data mesh, materialized view
- Time-related: vector clocks, logical clocks, HLC
- Security: e2e-encryption, key-management

#### Architecture Patterns
- Service mesh, cell-based, event-driven
- Lambda/Kappa architecture
- Polyglot persistence

## Navigation Integrity
✅ All enhanced patterns maintain proper navigation links
✅ mkdocs.yml structure remains intact
✅ Pattern index properly categorized
