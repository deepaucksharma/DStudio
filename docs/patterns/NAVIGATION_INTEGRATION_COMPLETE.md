## Summary

Successfully integrated all new excellence content into the main mkdocs.yml navigation structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Excellence Framework Section
Added a new top-level navigation section "Excellence Framework" after "Patterns" with the following structure:

```yaml
- Excellence Framework:
  - Overview: excellence/index.md
  - Framework: excellence/framework-overview.md
  - Guides:
    - Modern Systems 2025: excellence/guides/modern-distributed-systems-2025.md
    - Platform Engineering: excellence/guides/platform-engineering-playbook.md
    - Quick Start: excellence/guides/quick-start-guide.md
  - Migration Playbooks:
    - Overview: excellence/migrations/index.md
    - 2PC to Saga: excellence/migrations/2pc-to-saga.md
    - Polling to WebSocket: excellence/migrations/polling-to-websocket.md
    - Monolith to Microservices: excellence/migrations/monolith-to-microservices.md
    - Batch to Streaming: excellence/migrations/batch-to-streaming.md
  - Case Studies:

```

### 2. Updated Reference Section
Added two new items to the Quick Reference subsection:
- Pattern Health Dashboard: reference/pattern-health-dashboard.md
- Pattern Catalog: patterns/pattern-catalog.md

## Navigation Hierarchy

The updated navigation structure now follows this order:
1. Home
2. Learn (with 7 Laws, 5 Pillars, etc.)
3. Patterns
4. **Excellence Framework** (NEW)
5. Quantitative
6. Case Studies
7. Interviews
8. Human Factors
9. Reference (with Pattern Health Dashboard and Pattern Catalog)

## File Locations

All excellence content is organized under:
- `/docs/excellence/` - Main excellence framework content
- `/docs/excellence/guides/` - Implementation guides
- `/docs/excellence/migrations/` - Migration playbooks
- `/docs/excellence/case-studies/` - Excellence case studies

The Pattern Health Dashboard and Pattern Catalog are referenced in the Reference section for easy access.

## Next Steps

1. Test the navigation by running `mkdocs serve`
2. Verify all links are working correctly
3. Check that the visual hierarchy is maintained
4. Ensure mobile navigation works properly with the new sections
