# Lambda Architecture

!!! danger "ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Replaced by unified processing frameworks**
    
    Lambda architecture's dual pipeline approach (batch + stream) created operational complexity. Modern unified processing frameworks eliminate the need for maintaining separate systems.
    
    **Use modern alternatives:**
    - **Apache Beam** for unified batch/stream
    - **Delta Lake/Iceberg** for lakehouse architectures
    - **Flink/Spark Structured Streaming** for unified processing
