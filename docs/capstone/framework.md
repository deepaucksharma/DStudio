❌ Ignore operational aspects
❌ Forget about monitoring
❌ Leave documentation until the end

## FAQ

### Q: Can we use existing libraries/frameworks?
A: Yes, but you must understand and document what they do. The core distributed systems logic should be your own.

### Q: What if our system doesn't scale to 10 nodes?
A: Document why, show it scales as far as possible, and demonstrate understanding of the limitations.

### Q: How much code is expected?
A: Quality over quantity. Typical projects are 5,000-15,000 lines of code including tests.

### Q: Can we pivot after starting?
A: Yes, with instructor approval and updated timeline. Document the reasons for pivoting.

### Q: Is the project grade individual or team-based?
A: Both. 70% team grade based on project, 30% individual based on contribution and understanding.
