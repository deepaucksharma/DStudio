- Interactive decision trees for pattern selection
- Real implementation examples with code
- Performance benchmarks and anti-patterns to avoid

**Highlights**:
- 32 Gold patterns featured
- Company-specific implementation strategies
- Practical code examples for each pattern category
- Clear "Start Here" checklist for different scales
- Pattern combinations that work (Netflix Stack, Uber Model, etc.)

### 2. Platform Engineering Playbook (`platform-engineering-playbook.md`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide for building developer platforms with modern practices

- Real code examples for platform APIs
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### 3. Quick Start Guide (`quick-start-guide.md`)
**Purpose**: Practical 90-day roadmap for teams starting fresh in 2025

**Key Features**:
- Week 1: Essential patterns (circuit breakers, health checks, logging)
- Month 1: Scaling foundations (load balancing, caching, queues)
- Quarter 1: Production excellence (auto-scaling, monitoring, tracing)
- Complete code examples for each phase
- Production readiness checklist

**Highlights**:
- Day-by-day implementation guide

- References to case studies
- Connections to quantitative models
- Links to human factors considerations

## Actionability

All guides provide:
1. **Clear starting points** based on team size/scale
2. **Step-by-step implementation** guides
3. **Real company examples** showing patterns in production
4. **Code snippets** that can be used immediately
5. **Checklists** for tracking progress

## Target Audiences
