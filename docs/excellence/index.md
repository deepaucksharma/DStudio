## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **New to distributed systems?**
   - Start with the [Quick Start Guide](guides/quick-start-guide.md)
   - Review fundamental [Axioms](../part1-axioms/) and [Pillars](../part2-pillars/)

2. **Building a new system?**
   - Follow [Modern Distributed Systems 2025](guides/modern-distributed-systems-2025.md)
   - Apply patterns from our [Pattern Catalog](../patterns/)

3. **Migrating existing systems?**
   - Choose your [Migration Guide](migrations/)
   - Learn from [Case Studies](case-studies/)

4. **Scaling your platform?**
   - Implement the [Platform Engineering Playbook](guides/platform-engineering-playbook.md)
   - Adopt [Human Factors](../human-factors/) best practices

## 🎓 Key Principles

### 1. **Start Simple, Scale Smart**
Begin with the minimum viable architecture and evolve based on actual needs.

### 2. **Measure Everything**
You can't improve what you don't measure. Instrument early and often.

### 3. **Automate Ruthlessly**
If you do it twice, automate it. If it can fail, make it self-healing.

### 4. **Design for Failure**
Systems will fail. Design for graceful degradation and fast recovery.

### 5. **Developer Experience First**
Happy developers build better systems. Optimize for developer productivity.
