2. **Design Simple E-commerce System** (15 min)
   - Apply patterns to handle 100K users
   - Identify potential failure points
   - Plan for growth to 1M users

3. **Validate Design** (10 min)
   - Check against [resilience guide](../implementation-guides/resilience-first/)
   - Review similar [case studies](../real-world-excellence/)

### Challenge 2: Modernize a Legacy System
**For:** Teams with existing systems

1. **Assess Current State** (10 min)
   - Identify Bronze patterns in use
   - Map system boundaries
   - Find pain points

2. **Plan Migration** (15 min)
   - Select target Gold/Silver patterns
   - Use [migration guides](../migrations/)
   - Create phased approach

3. **Quick Win Implementation** (5 min)
   - Pick one pattern to implement first
   - Estimate effort and impact

### Challenge 3: Build Team Excellence
**For:** Engineering managers

1. **Excellence Assessment** (10 min)
   - Review team's pattern knowledge
   - Identify skill gaps
   - Check current practices

2. **Create Learning Plan** (10 min)
   - Pick 3 patterns to master
   - Assign pattern champions
   - Schedule knowledge sharing

3. **Set Excellence Goals** (10 min)
   - Define success metrics
   - Create implementation timeline
   - Plan first sprint

## Next Steps by Experience Level

### New to Distributed Systems?
1. Start with [Fundamentals](../../part1-axioms/)

3. Study [beginner case studies](../real-world-excellence/system-implementations/by-scale/#startup)

### Experienced but New to Excellence Framework?
1. Explore [Pattern Discovery Tool](../pattern-discovery/)
2. Compare your patterns with [Excellence Tiers](../pattern-discovery/#tiers)
3. Plan [migrations](../migrations/) from Bronze to Gold

### Ready to Transform?
1. Choose an [Excellence Journey](../excellence-journeys/)
2. Build with [Implementation Guides](../implementation-guides/)
3. Learn from [Elite Engineering](../real-world-excellence/elite-engineering/)

## Quick Reference Cards

<div class="reference-cards">

### Most Used Gold Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker** - Prevent cascade failures
