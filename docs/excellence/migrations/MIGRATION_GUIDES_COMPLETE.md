# Migration Guides Summary

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive migration guides for transitioning from Bronze-tier patterns to Gold-tier alternatives. Each guide provides battle-tested approaches, real-world examples, and step-by-step instructions based on production migrations.

## Available Migration Guides

### 1. [Two-Phase Commit to Saga Migration](../../excellence/migrations/2pc-to-saga.md)

**Purpose:** Transform distributed transactions from synchronous, blocking 2PC to asynchronous, eventually consistent Saga pattern.

**Key Features:**
- Pre-migration assessment checklist with scoring system
- Week-by-week migration plan (8 weeks typical)
- Parallel infrastructure approach for risk mitigation
- Common pitfalls with proven solutions
- Real company case studies (E-commerce and Financial Services)

**Migration Complexity:**
- Simple (2-3 services): 2-3 months
- Medium (4-6 services): 3-6 months  
- Complex (7+ services): 6-12 months

**Success Metrics:**
- 60% reduction in transaction failures
- 40% improvement in completion time
- 90% reduction in database locks

---

### 2. [Polling to WebSocket/SSE Migration](../../excellence/migrations/polling-to-websocket.md)

**Purpose:** Reduce server load and improve real-time user experience by migrating from resource-intensive polling to efficient WebSocket or Server-Sent Events.

**Key Features:**
- ROI calculator for migration decision
- Progressive enhancement client strategy
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- Load balancer configuration examples
- Performance benchmark data

**When to Migrate:**
- Polling frequency < 5 seconds
- Concurrent users > 10,000
- Infrastructure cost > $10K/month
- Bandwidth usage > 100GB/day

**Expected Improvements:**
- 90% bandwidth reduction
- 98% latency reduction
- 70% server cost savings
- 66% CPU usage reduction

### 3. [Monolith to Microservices Migration](../../excellence/migrations/monolith-to-microservices.md)

**Purpose:** Properly decompose monolithic applications into microservices using Domain-Driven Design and avoiding common anti-patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Service boundary identification framework
- Strangler Fig pattern implementation
- Data isolation strategies with examples
- Communication pattern selection matrix
- Anti-patterns to avoid (with solutions)

**Migration Strategies:**
- Strangler Fig for gradual migration
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- CQRS for read/write separation
- Service mesh for communication

**Common Anti-patterns Addressed:**
- Distributed monolith
- Chatty services
- Shared databases
- Synchronous cascading failures

---

### 4. [Batch to Streaming Migration](../../excellence/migrations/batch-to-streaming.md)

**Purpose:** Transform batch processing systems to real-time stream processing for immediate insights and reduced latency.

**Key Features:**
- MapReduce to Kafka Streams translation
- State management migration strategies
- Exactly-once processing implementation
- Performance tuning guidelines
- Real-world examples (E-commerce, Financial)

**Migration Timeline:**
- Setup & Infrastructure: 2 weeks
- Shadow Mode Testing: 3-4 weeks
- Gradual Migration: 3-4 weeks
- Optimization & Cleanup: 2 weeks

**Expected Results:**
- Latency: Hours → Seconds
- Visibility: T+1 day → Real-time
- Cost: +30% initially, -20% after optimization

## Migration Decision Framework

### When to Use Each Guide

| Current State | Business Need | Recommended Migration |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 2PC with failures | Better fault tolerance | → Saga Pattern |
| High-frequency polling | Real-time updates | → WebSocket/SSE |
| Slow monolith releases | Team autonomy | → Microservices |
| Overnight batch jobs | Real-time analytics | → Stream Processing |

### Universal Migration Principles

1. **Parallel Run Strategy**
   - Always run new system in shadow mode first
   - Compare results between old and new systems
   - Gradually shift traffic with monitoring

2. **Incremental Migration**
   - Start with low-risk, high-value use cases
   - Build confidence with each successful migration
   - Keep rollback procedures ready

3. **Monitoring First**
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring before migration
   - Define SLAs and success metrics upfront
   - Use feature flags for quick rollback

4. **Team Readiness**
   - Train team on new patterns before migration
   - Document runbooks and procedures
   - Practice failure scenarios
