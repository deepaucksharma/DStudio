### Phase 2: Foundation Building (Week 3-4)

#### Objectives
- Set up infrastructure
- Implement core components
- Establish monitoring
- Create safety mechanisms

#### Key Tasks

| Task | Description | Duration | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Infrastructure Setup | Provision servers, networks, tools | 2 days | None |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Automated build and deploy | 1 day | Infrastructure |
| Monitoring Stack | Metrics, logs, traces | 2 days | Infrastructure |
| Feature Flags | Progressive rollout capability | 1 day | CI/CD |

#### Code Examples

**Example: Setting up feature flags for gradual migration**
```python
class FeatureFlags:
    def __init__(self, config_source):
        self.config = config_source
    
    def is_new_pattern_enabled(self, user_id: str) -> bool:
        # Gradual rollout based on user percentage
        percentage = self.config.get("new_pattern_rollout_percentage", 0)
        user_hash = hashlib.md5(user_id.encode()).hexdigest()
        user_bucket = int(user_hash[:8], 16) % 100
        return user_bucket < percentage
    
    def route_request(self, user_id: str, request: Request):
        if self.is_new_pattern_enabled(user_id):
            return self.new_pattern_handler(request)
        return self.legacy_pattern_handler(request)
```

### Phase 3: Incremental Migration (Week 5-12)

#### Migration Strategies

<div class="strategy-cards">

##### Strategy A: Strangler Fig Pattern
Best for: Monolith to Microservices

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Step 1"
        M1[Monolith] --> U1[Users]
    end
    
    subgraph "Step 2"
        P[Proxy]
        M2[Monolith]
        S1[Service 1]
        U2[Users] --> P
        P --> M2
        P --> S1
    end
    
    subgraph "Step 3"
        P2[Proxy]
        S2[Service 1]
        S3[Service 2]
        S4[Service 3]
        U3[Users] --> P2
        P2 --> S2
        P2 --> S3
        P2 --> S4
    end
```

##### Strategy B: Parallel Run
Best for: Data store migrations

```python
def dual_write_pattern(data):
    # Write to both old and new systems
    try:
        legacy_result = legacy_system.write(data)
        new_result = new_system.write(data)
        
        # Compare results for validation
        if not results_match(legacy_result, new_result):
            log_discrepancy(data, legacy_result, new_result)
        
        return legacy_result  # Still return legacy result
    except NewSystemException as e:
        # New system failures don't affect users
        log_error("New system write failed", e)
        return legacy_result
```

##### Strategy C: Blue-Green Deployment
Best for: Complete cutover scenarios

</div>

#### Weekly Milestones

| Week | Goal | Success Criteria | Rollback Trigger |
|------|------|------------------|------------------|
| 5-6 | Migrate 10% traffic | Error rate < 0.1% | Error rate > 1% |
| 7-8 | Migrate 25% traffic | Latency < 110% of baseline | Latency > 150% |
| 9-10 | Migrate 50% traffic | All metrics stable | Any SLA breach |
| 11-12 | Complete migration | 100% on new pattern | Critical issues |

### Phase 4: Optimization and Cleanup (Week 13-16)

#### Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Performance Tuning**
   ```yaml
   optimizations:
     - Cache warming strategies
     - Connection pool sizing
     - Query optimization
     - Resource right-sizing
   ```

2. **Legacy Cleanup**
   - Remove old code paths
   - Decommission legacy infrastructure
   - Archive historical data
   - Update documentation

3. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Team training sessions
   - Runbook creation
   - Incident response procedures
   - Architecture decision records

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Big Bang Migration
**Problem**: Attempting to migrate everything at once
**Solution**: Use incremental approach with feature flags

### Pitfall 2: Inadequate Testing
**Problem**: Not testing edge cases and failure scenarios
**Solution**: Comprehensive test strategy including:
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for interactions
- Performance tests under load
- Chaos engineering for failures

### Pitfall 3: Data Inconsistency
**Problem**: Data divergence between old and new systems
**Solution**: Implement reconciliation process:
```python
def reconcile_data():
    legacy_data = fetch_legacy_data()
    new_data = fetch_new_data()
    
    discrepancies = []
    for key in legacy_data:
        if key not in new_data:
            discrepancies.append(("missing", key))
        elif legacy_data[key] != new_data[key]:
            discrepancies.append(("mismatch", key, 
                                legacy_data[key], new_data[key]))
    
    return discrepancies
```
