# Pattern Usage Examples

## 1. Gold Pattern Usage Index

### Circuit Breaker Pattern Usage

The circuit breaker pattern page would show real-world usage like this:

```markdown
## Real-World Implementations

### Internet Scale (100M+ users)

| Company | Implementation | Scale | Success Metric |
|---------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| **Netflix** | Hystrix handles all microservice calls | 100B+ requests/day | 99.99% availability despite AWS issues |
| **Amazon** | Circuit breakers on all service boundaries | 10x Prime Day traffic | Zero cascade failures in 2023 |
| **Uber** | Payment and dispatch protection | 20M+ rides/day | < 5 minute recovery from failures |

```

### Event Sourcing Pattern Usage

```markdown
## Financial Systems

```

### Global Scale Systems (Multi-region)

```markdown
# Global Scale Excellence

Systems operating across multiple regions with strong consistency requirements.

## Payment Processing

### Stripe ($640B+ processed annually)
**Excellence Tier**: Gold
**Scale Metrics**:
- 65,000 TPS peak
- 99.99% availability
- 0 data loss in 10 years

**Pattern Stack**:
- 🥇 Event Sourcing (immutable audit trail)
- 🥇 Saga Pattern (distributed transactions)
- 🥇 Idempotency (exactly-once guarantees)
- 🥈 CQRS (separated read/write paths)
- 🥈 Sharding (64 shards by merchant)

```

## 3. Domain-Based Organization

### Financial Systems Excellence

```markdown
# Financial Systems Pattern Guide

## Core Patterns (Must Have)

### 🥇 Gold Standard
1. **Event Sourcing** - Immutable audit trail
   - Stripe: Every transaction as event
   - PayPal: 400M+ accounts tracked
   - Square: Complete payment history

2. **Idempotency** - Exactly-once processing
   - All payment APIs must be idempotent
   - 24-hour key retention minimum
   - UUID + timestamp + amount as key

3. **Double-Entry Ledger** - Financial accuracy
   - Every debit has matching credit
   - Daily reconciliation required
   - Immutable entries only

### 🥈 Scale Enablers
1. **CQRS** - Separate read/write paths
2. **Sharding** - Horizontal scaling
3. **Multi-Region** - Global presence

### 🥉 Legacy Patterns (Avoid)
1. **Two-Phase Commit** - Use Saga pattern instead
2. **Synchronous Processing** - Move to event-driven
```

## 4. Cross-Reference Examples

### Pattern to Case Studies

Each pattern page would include a section like:

```markdown
## Production Examples

### Netflix Streaming Platform
- **Scale**: 260M+ subscribers, 15% of internet traffic
- **Implementation**: Hystrix library for all service calls
- **Configuration**: 50ms timeout, 50% error threshold
- **Result**: Survived 2012 AWS outage with graceful degradation

[View Full Architecture →](../../case-studies/netflix-streaming)

### Uber Real-Time Location
- **Scale**: 15M+ drivers, 100M+ location updates/day  
- **Implementation**: Circuit breakers on location service calls
- **Configuration**: 200ms timeout, 60% error threshold
- **Result**: Maintained service during 2016 New Year's surge

```

### Case Study to Patterns

Each case study would include pattern badges and links:

```markdown
## Architecture Patterns

### Core Patterns 🏆
- [Circuit Breaker](../../patterns/circuit-breaker) 🥇 - 100B+ requests protected
- [Event Sourcing](../../patterns/event-sourcing) 🥇 - Complete viewing history
- [CQRS](../../patterns/cqrs) 🥇 - Separated read/write paths
- [Chaos Engineering](../../patterns/chaos-engineering) 🥇 - Pioneered the practice

```

## 5. Excellence Dashboard Integration

The pattern health dashboard would show:

```javascript
// Real-time metrics from case studies
const patternUsage = {
  "circuit-breaker": {
    companies: ["Netflix", "Amazon", "Uber", "Twitter"],
    totalRequests: "100B+/day",
    adoptionTrend: "+15% QoQ",
    successStories: 47
  },
  "event-sourcing": {
    companies: ["Stripe", "Netflix", "Uber", "PayPal"],
    totalEvents: "1T+/day",
    adoptionTrend: "+25% QoQ",
    successStories: 35
  }
};
```

## 6. Migration Guide References

```markdown
## From Polling to Streaming

### Success Story: Uber Location System

**Timeline**: 2009-2015
**Scale**: From 1K to 100M+ daily updates

**Migration Steps**:
1. Started with 30-second MySQL polling (2009)
2. Added Redis cache, reduced to 5 seconds (2011)
3. Introduced Kafka streaming in parallel (2013)
4. Dual-write for 6 months
5. Complete cutover to streaming (2015)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Polling worked fine until ~1M daily rides
- Dual-write period essential for confidence
- City-by-city rollout reduced risk
