## Integration Points

The Excellence Framework integrates with:
- **Axioms** (Part 1): Fundamental laws reference
- **Pillars** (Part 2): Core concepts foundation
- **Patterns**: Implementation patterns catalog
- **Quantitative**: Analysis tools and calculators
- **Human Factors**: Operational excellence practices
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples

## Next Steps

1. **Add Case Studies**: Partner with companies to document real implementations
2. **Interactive Tools**: Build calculators and decision tools
3. **Update Navigation**: Add excellence section to main mkdocs.yml
4. **Continuous Updates**: Keep guides current with latest practices

## File Locations

All excellence content is now properly organized:
- Main directory: `/home/deepak/DStudio/docs/excellence/`
- Previous location files moved from: `/home/deepak/DStudio/docs/patterns/excellence/`
- All navigation indexes created and linked

The Excellence Framework is now fully structured and ready for use!
