# Pattern Comparison Matrices

Making informed architectural decisions requires understanding the trade-offs between similar patterns. These comparison matrices help you choose the right pattern for your specific use case.

## Available Comparisons

### üì® [Messaging Patterns](messaging-patterns-comparison.md)
Compare **Pub-Sub vs Event Streaming vs Message Queue vs WebSocket**
- When to use synchronous vs asynchronous messaging
- Scaling characteristics and limitations
- Real-world examples from Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Redis

### üîÑ [Consistency Patterns](consistency-patterns-comparison.md)
Compare **2PC vs Saga vs Event Sourcing vs CQRS**
- Consistency guarantees and trade-offs
- Complexity vs flexibility analysis
- Migration paths from legacy to modern patterns

### üíæ [Caching Patterns](caching-patterns-comparison.md)
Compare **Client-side vs CDN vs Application vs Database Caching**
- Performance characteristics at each layer
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Cost optimization techniques

### üöÄ [Deployment Patterns](deployment-patterns-comparison.md)
Compare **Blue-Green vs Canary vs Rolling vs Feature Flags**

## Quick Decision Framework

### 1. Start with Requirements
- What problem are you solving?
- What are your constraints? (latency, consistency, cost)
- What's your scale? (requests/sec, data volume)

### 2. Review Relevant Comparison
- Check the overview table
- Study the decision matrix
- Review real-world examples

### 3. Consider Trade-offs
- Performance vs complexity
- Cost vs features
- Flexibility vs simplicity

### 4. Plan Migration
- If replacing existing pattern
- Check migration paths
- Consider hybrid approaches

## Pattern Selection Checklist

- [ ] **Problem clearly defined** - Know what you're solving
- [ ] **Scale requirements known** - Current and projected
- [ ] **Constraints identified** - Technical and business
- [ ] **Team expertise assessed** - Can your team implement/maintain?
- [ ] **Comparison reviewed** - Studied relevant matrices
- [ ] **Examples checked** - Found similar use cases
- [ ] **Migration planned** - If replacing existing solution
- [ ] **Monitoring defined** - Know how to measure success

## Common Pitfalls

<div class=\"failure-vignette\">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Pattern Overengineering</h4>

**Mistake**: Choosing the most sophisticated pattern without need
**Example**: Using Event Sourcing for simple CRUD operations
**Solution**: Start simple, evolve as needed
</div>

<div class=\"failure-vignette\">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Ignoring Team Expertise</h4>

**Mistake**: Selecting patterns beyond team capabilities
**Example**: Implementing CQRS without understanding eventual consistency
**Solution**: Factor in learning curve and operational complexity
</div>

<div class=\"failure-vignette\">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Not Planning for Migration</h4>

**Mistake**: Assuming clean-slate implementation
**Example**: Trying to move from 2PC to Saga overnight
**Solution**: Use gradual migration strategies
</div>
