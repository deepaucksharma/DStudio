# About This Compendium

## Mission

To provide a rigorous, physics-based foundation for understanding distributed systems that transcends specific technologies and trends.

## Philosophy

We believe that distributed systems education should:

1. **Start from First Principles**: Begin with the laws of physics, not with specific algorithms
2. **Build Understanding Systematically**: Each concept builds on previous foundations
3. **Emphasize Trade-offs**: There are no perfect solutions, only informed choices
4. **Learn from Failures**: Real-world disasters teach more than perfect theories

## The Approach

### 8 Fundamental Axioms
1. **Latency** - The speed of light creates unavoidable delays
2. **Finite Capacity** - Resources are always limited
3. **Failure** - Components will fail, networks will partition
4. **Concurrency** - Multiple things happen simultaneously
5. **Coordination** - Agreement requires communication
6. **Observability** - You can't debug what you can't see
7. **Human Interface** - Systems must be operable under stress
8. **Economics** - Every decision has a cost

### 5 Foundational Pillars
Built on the axioms, these pillars support all distributed systems:
- **Work** - How computation is distributed
- **State** - How data is stored and replicated
- **Truth** - How systems agree on facts
- **Control** - How systems adapt and heal
- **Intelligence** - How systems learn and improve

## Technology Stack
