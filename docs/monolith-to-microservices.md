## Overview

Monolith to microservices migration is a strategic transformation process that involves decomposing a large, unified application into smaller, independently deployable services. This architectural evolution enables greater scalability, team autonomy, and technology diversity while introducing challenges around distributed system complexity, data consistency, and service coordination. The migration requires careful planning, incremental implementation strategies, and comprehensive monitoring to ensure system reliability throughout the transition.


## Prerequisites

Before beginning a monolith decomposition, teams should have established containerization capabilities, continuous integration and deployment pipelines, comprehensive monitoring and logging systems, and experience with distributed systems patterns. Understanding of service boundaries, data modeling, and API design principles is essential, along with organizational readiness for managing multiple service teams and deployment coordination.


## Steps

Successful monolith migration follows a structured approach: comprehensive system analysis and service boundary identification, implementation of monitoring and observability tools, gradual service extraction using patterns like strangler fig, establishment of service communication protocols, data migration and consistency strategies, and iterative testing and validation of extracted services.
