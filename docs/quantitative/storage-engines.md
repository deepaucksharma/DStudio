# Storage Engines

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Analysis of storage engine architectures including LSM trees, B-trees, and hybrid approaches for distributed systems.

## Key Concepts
- Write amplification factors
- Read amplification analysis
- Space amplification trade-offs
- Compaction strategies
- Memory vs disk trade-offs

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Key-value stores (Redis, RocksDB)
- Distributed databases (Cassandra, HBase)
- Time-series databases
- Log-structured storage systems
