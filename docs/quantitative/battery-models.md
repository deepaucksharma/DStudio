# Battery Models

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Battery models quantify power consumption patterns in mobile and edge computing scenarios, crucial for distributed systems that include mobile clients or IoT devices.

## Key Concepts
- Power consumption profiles (CPU, network, GPS, screen)
- Battery discharge curves
- Energy-delay product optimization
- Adaptive power management
- Wake lock patterns

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Mobile app synchronization strategies
- Edge computing power optimization
- IoT device communication protocols
- Location service battery impact
- Push notification efficiency
