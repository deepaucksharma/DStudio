# Storage Economics

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Storage economics models the cost optimization and trade-offs in distributed storage systems, including tiered storage, compression, replication costs, and lifecycle management.

## Key Concepts
- Cost per GB across storage tiers (hot, warm, cold, archive)
- Storage efficiency metrics (compression ratios, deduplication rates)
- Replication factor economics
- Data lifecycle costs
- Access pattern optimization

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Cloud storage tiering strategies
- Backup and archive cost optimization
- Content delivery network storage
- Database storage planning
- Object storage lifecycle policies
