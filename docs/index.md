## üìñ About This Compendium

### Our Philosophy

This compendium teaches distributed systems from the ground up, starting with fundamental physics and mathematics rather than jumping straight into technologies. We derive patterns from constraints, not fashion.

**Why Another Systems Resource?**

Existing distributed systems literature falls into two camps: academic proofs divorced from practice, or engineering cookbooks lacking theoretical foundation. This resource uniquely provides the **'why from first principles.'**

We don't start with Kafka or Kubernetes. We start with the speed of light and the laws of thermodynamics. Every pattern emerges from inescapable constraints.

### Key Principles

1. **Physics First** - Begin with the laws of physics, not algorithms
2. **Build Systematically** - Each concept builds on previous foundations
3. **Emphasize Trade-offs** - No perfect solutions, only informed choices
4. **Learn from Failures** - Real-world disasters teach more than theories
5. **Quantify Everything** - Mathematics beats intuition for complex systems
