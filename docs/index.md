## Why This Approach?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-atom:{ .lg .middle } __Physics-Based__

 ---

 Every concept derives from fundamental constraints like the speed of light and thermodynamics.

- :material-infinity:{ .lg .middle } __Timeless Principles__

 ---

 Learn principles that remain true regardless of technology trends or vendor solutions.

- :material-cog:{ .lg .middle } __Practical Application__

 ---

 Each concept includes real-world case studies, failure scenarios, and implementation guidance.
