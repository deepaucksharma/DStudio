### By Experience Level
- **[New Graduate Path](learning-paths/index.md#new-graduate-path)** - Start from fundamentals
- **[Mid-Level Engineer Path](learning-paths/index.md#mid-level-path)** - Fill knowledge gaps
- **[Senior Engineer Path](learning-paths/index.md#senior-path)** - Master advanced concepts
- **[Technical Leader Path](learning-paths/index.md#leader-path)** - Strategic system design

### By Immediate Need
- **[Debugging a distributed system?](patterns/observability.md)** â†’ Observability patterns
- **[System keeps failing?](patterns/circuit-breaker.md)** â†’ Resilience patterns
- **[Need to scale?](patterns/sharding.md)** â†’ Scaling patterns
- **[Consistency issues?](patterns/consistency-models.md)** â†’ Consistency patterns

## ðŸ“š What Makes This Different?

<div class="law-box">
<h3>ðŸ”¬ Physics-First Approach</h3>

We derive distributed systems principles from fundamental constraints:

- **Speed of light** â†’ Network latency is unavoidable
- **Thermodynamics** â†’ Failure is inevitable
- **Information theory** â†’ Perfect knowledge is impossible
- **Economics** â†’ Resources are always limited

This approach provides deep understanding that transcends specific technologies.

## ðŸš€ Start Learning

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   __Foundation First__

    Begin with the [7 Fundamental Laws](part1-axioms/index.md) to understand the constraints

-   __Build Understanding__

    Study the [5 Pillars](part2-pillars/index.md) to organize your thinking

-   __Apply Knowledge__

    Explore [Patterns](patterns/index.md) and [Case Studies](case-studies/index.md)

-   __Go Deeper__

    Use the [Quantitative Toolkit](quantitative/index.md) for rigorous analysis
