## About This Compendium

This compendium teaches distributed systems from the ground up, starting with fundamental physics and mathematics rather than jumping straight into technologies. We derive patterns from constraints, not fashion.

### Why Another Systems Resource?

Existing distributed systems literature falls into two camps: academic proofs divorced from practice, or engineering cookbooks lacking theoretical foundation. This resource uniquely provides the **'why from first principles.'**

We don't start with Kafka or Kubernetes. We start with the speed of light and the laws of thermodynamics. Every pattern emerges from inescapable constraints.

## The Foundation: Eight Axioms

Everything in distributed systems emerges from these eight fundamental constraints:

{{ card(type='axiom', title='1. Latency', content='Information cannot travel faster than light', link='/part1-axioms/axiom1-latency/') }}

{{ card(type='axiom', title='2. Capacity', content='Resources are finite and constrained', link='/part1-axioms/axiom2-capacity/') }}

{{ card(type='axiom', title='3. Failure', content='Components fail partially, not completely', link='/part1-axioms/axiom3-failure/') }}

{{ card(type='axiom', title='4. Concurrency', content='Events happen simultaneously', link='/part1-axioms/axiom4-concurrency/') }}

{{ card(type='axiom', title='5. Coordination', content='Agreement requires communication', link='/part1-axioms/axiom5-coordination/') }}

{{ card(type='axiom', title='6. Observability', content='You cannot debug what you cannot see', link='/part1-axioms/axiom6-observability/') }}

{{ card(type='axiom', title='7. Human Interface', content='Systems must be operable under stress', link='/part1-axioms/axiom7-human/') }}

## The Journey

<div class="journey-overview">

### Part I: Fundamental Axioms
Learn the eight constraints that govern all distributed systems. Start here to understand **why** systems behave as they do.

### Part II: Foundational Pillars  
Discover how axioms combine to create five foundational patterns: Work, State, Truth, Control, and Intelligence.

### Part III: Modern Patterns
Explore battle-tested architectural patterns derived from first principles, from CQRS to service mesh.

### Part IV: Quantitative Toolkit
Master the mathematics and economics of distributed systems with practical tools and calculators.

### Part V: Human Factors
Understand the human element: operations, chaos engineering, and organizational design.

## What You'll Learn

- **Derive patterns** from first principles, not memorize them
- **Quantify trade-offs** with actual calculations  
- **Predict failures** before they happen
- **Design systems** that work with physics, not against it

## Quick Reference

### Key Principles
1. **Physics First** - Begin with the laws of physics, not algorithms
2. **Build Systematically** - Each concept builds on previous foundations  
3. **Emphasize Trade-offs** - No perfect solutions, only informed choices
4. **Learn from Failures** - Real-world disasters teach more than theories

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Amdahl's Law** - Theoretical speedup limits
- **Little's Law** - Queue length and latency relationships
- **CAP Theorem** - Consistency, availability, partition tolerance
- **Coordination Costs** - The price of distributed agreement
