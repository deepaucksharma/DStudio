# The Compendium of Distributed Systems

!!! abstract "Comprehensive Guide for Engineers & Architects Building Distributed Systems"
    **Master distributed systems through physics-derived principles and battle-tested patterns.**
    
    **7 Fundamental Laws** ‚Ä¢ **5 Core Pillars** ‚Ä¢ **91 Design Patterns** ‚Ä¢ **150+ Real Examples**

Welcome to the definitive resource for understanding distributed systems from first principles. This compendium organizes complex concepts into a physics-based framework that reveals the immutable laws governing all distributed architectures. Whether you're a new graduate learning the fundamentals or a senior architect designing systems at scale, this guide provides maximum conceptual depth with minimum cognitive load.
