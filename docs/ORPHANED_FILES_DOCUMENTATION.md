# Orphaned Files Documentation

This document explains files that are intentionally not included in the main navigation structure.

## Why Some Files Are Orphaned

Many files in this documentation are intentionally not included in the main navigation for various reasons:

1. **Supplementary Content**: Additional resources linked from main pages
2. **Deep Dive Topics**: Specialized content for advanced users
3. **Company-Specific Content**: Detailed company examples that would clutter main navigation
4. **Interactive Tools**: Standalone tools and calculators
5. **Templates and Includes**: Files meant to be included in other files

## Intentionally Orphaned Files by Category

### Interview Preparation - Deep Content
These files are linked from parent pages but not directly in navigation to avoid overwhelming the nav structure:

- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-3-applications/business-acumen/business-metrics/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-3-applications/organizational-design/team-topologies/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-3-applications/people-management/hiring-interviewing/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-3-applications/people-management/team-building-culture/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-3-applications/technical-leadership/technical-strategy/index.md`

### Interactive Tools
These are standalone tools accessed through their parent sections:

- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-4-interview-execution/tools/interactive/decision-trees/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-4-interview-execution/tools/interactive/interview-timer/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-4-interview-execution/tools/interactive/question-bank/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-4-interview-execution/tools/interactive/self-assessment/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/level-4-interview-execution/tools/interactive/star-matcher/index.md`

### Practice Scenarios
Detailed scenario files linked from the main practice section:

- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/practice-scenarios/stakeholder-negotiation-scenario/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/practice-scenarios/team-conflict-scenario/index.md`
- `interview-prep/engineering-leadership/practice-scenarios/underperformer-scenario/index.md`

### Company-Specific Content
Detailed company information accessed through the company index:

- `company-specific/amazon/index.md`
- `company-specific/apple/index.md`
- `company-specific/google/index.md`
- `company-specific/meta/index.md`
- `company-specific/microsoft/index.md`
- `company-specific/netflix/index.md`

### Templates and Includes
Files meant to be included in other documents:

- `templates/abbreviations.md`
- Various template files in pattern-library sections

## Navigation Strategy

These files follow a hub-and-spoke model:
- **Hub pages** are in the main navigation
- **Spoke pages** (orphaned files) are linked from hub pages
- This keeps the main navigation clean while providing deep content

## How to Access Orphaned Files

1. Through their parent pages in the navigation
2. Through search functionality
3. Through cross-references in other documents
4. Direct URL access for bookmarked content

## Maintenance Notes

When adding new content:
1. Consider if it should be in main navigation or linked from a parent
2. Large sections with many sub-pages often benefit from hub-and-spoke organization
3. Interactive tools and specialized content are usually better as orphaned files
4. Always ensure orphaned files are properly linked from at least one navigable page
