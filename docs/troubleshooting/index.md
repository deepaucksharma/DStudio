# Troubleshooting Guide

Comprehensive troubleshooting resources for diagnosing and resolving issues in distributed systems.

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### [Performance Issues](performance-issues.md)
- Slow response times
- High latency
- Resource exhaustion
- Bottleneck identification

#### [System Failures](system-failures.md)
- Service outages
- Cascading failures
- Network partitions
- Data inconsistencies

## Troubleshooting Framework

### 1. Identify Symptoms
- What is the observed behavior?
- When did it start?
- What changed recently?
- Who is affected?

### 2. Gather Data
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, disk
- **Logs**: Application, system, security
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing data
- **Events**: Deployments, config changes

### 3. Form Hypothesis
- Based on symptoms and data
- Consider recent changes
- Check for known issues
- Review similar past incidents

### 4. Test and Verify
- Isolate the problem
- Test hypothesis systematically
- Document findings
- Validate root cause

### 5. Implement Fix
- Apply targeted solution
- Monitor for resolution
- Document the fix
- Update runbooks

## Common Problem Categories

### Performance Problems
- **High Latency**: Network issues, slow queries, resource contention
- **Low Throughput**: Bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, scaling limits
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory leaks, connection pools, disk space

### Reliability Issues
- **Service Failures**: Crashes, deadlocks, infinite loops
- **Data Corruption**: Race conditions, inconsistent state, replication lag
- **Network Problems**: Partitions, packet loss, DNS issues

### Scalability Challenges
- **Load Issues**: Traffic spikes, uneven distribution, hotspots
- **Capacity Problems**: Under-provisioning, quota limits, rate limiting
- **Coordination Failures**: Split-brain, consensus issues, leader election

## Diagnostic Tools

### Monitoring Tools
- Metrics collection (Prometheus, DataDog)
- Log aggregation (ELK, Splunk)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- APM solutions (New Relic, AppDynamics)

### Analysis Techniques
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)
- Performance profiling
- Load testing
- Chaos engineering

### Command-Line Tools
```bash
# Network diagnostics
netstat, ss, tcpdump, traceroute

# System resources
top, htop, iostat, vmstat

# Application debugging
strace, ltrace, gdb, perf
```

## Troubleshooting by Component

### Databases
- Slow queries
- Lock contention
- Replication lag
- Connection pool exhaustion

### Message Queues
- Message backlog
- Consumer lag
- Dead letter queues
- Poison messages

### Load Balancers
- Uneven distribution
- Health check failures
- Connection limits
- SSL/TLS issues

### Caches
- Cache misses
- Eviction storms
- Stale data
- Memory pressure

## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed incident reports
2. **Build Runbooks**: Create step-by-step troubleshooting guides
3. **Automate Detection**: Set up proactive monitoring and alerts
4. **Practice Incidents**: Run game days and disaster recovery drills
5. **Learn from Failures**: Conduct blameless post-mortems

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Outage Response
1. Assess impact and severity
2. Notify stakeholders
3. Implement immediate mitigation
4. Begin root cause investigation
5. Document timeline and actions
6. Conduct post-mortem

### Data Loss Prevention
1. Stop writes if corruption detected
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Verify backup integrity
4. Plan recovery strategy
5. Execute recovery with validation
6. Implement prevention measures
