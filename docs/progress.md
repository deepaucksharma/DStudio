# Learning Progress Tracker

Progress tracking for distributed systems learning enables structured skill development through measurable learning objectives, milestone completion tracking, and competency assessment across core distributed systems concepts and patterns.

## Overview

The learning progress tracker provides a systematic approach to mastering distributed systems concepts through structured pathways, interactive assessments, and milestone-based progression tracking. This tool helps learners identify knowledge gaps, focus study efforts on specific areas, and validate understanding through practical exercises and real-world scenario applications.


## Prerequisites

To effectively use the progress tracker, learners should have basic programming knowledge, understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, and familiarity with software engineering principles. Access to development environments for hands-on practice and willingness to engage with complex technical concepts are essential for successful learning progression.


## Steps

Using the progress tracker involves selecting appropriate learning paths based on current skill level, completing prerequisite assessments, working through structured modules and exercises, tracking completion of milestones and objectives, and regularly reviewing progress to identify areas requiring additional focus and study.


## Examples

Below are sample ways to record and review progress:

### Milestone tracking for a learning path

| Date       | Path        | Milestone                            | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| 2025-08-07 | Foundations | Complete module 1: Work Distribution | ‚úÖ Done |
| 2025-08-08 | Foundations | Quiz for module 1                    | üöß In progress |
| 2025-08-09 | Foundations | Begin module 2: State Distribution   | ‚è≥ Planned |

### Use case: skill refresh cycle

1. Select the "Flow Control" module.
2. Log daily practice exercises in the tracker.
3. Mark the milestone complete when practice questions reach 80% accuracy.


## Troubleshooting

Common issues and fixes:

- **Lost progress entries**
  - Verify that the tracker is synced to a remote repository or cloud storage.
  - Restore from a previous commit or backup of `LEARNING_MODULE_TRACKER.md` if available.
- **Incorrect milestone status**
  - Confirm that milestones map to the correct module and update the entry if needed.
  - Recalculate completion metrics after making corrections.


## Next Steps

- Explore detailed learning paths in the [Start Here](start-here/) guide to choose your next module.
- Use the [Learning Module Tracker](../LEARNING_MODULE_TRACKER.md) for full module tracking across the 7 Fundamental Laws.
- Try advanced tools such as the [Availability Calculator](architects-handbook/tools/availability-calculator/) or the [Pattern Health Dashboard](reference/pattern-health-dashboard/) to plan future study sessions.
