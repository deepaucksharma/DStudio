# The 7 Fundamental Laws

> Immutable laws derived from physics that govern all distributed systems

## Overview {#overview}

These laws represent fundamental constraints that no amount of engineering can overcome. They are derived from the laws of physics—particularly the speed of light and thermodynamics—and shape every aspect of distributed system design.

## The Laws {#the-laws}

- **[Law of Correlated Failure](correlated-failure/)** 
    
    ---
    
    Failures in distributed systems are never independent

- **[Law of Asynchronous Reality](asynchronous-reality/)**
    
    ---
    
    Perfect synchronization is impossible in distributed systems

- **[Law of Emergent Chaos](emergent-chaos/)**
    
    ---
    
    Complex behaviors emerge from simple interactions

- **[Law of Multidimensional Optimization](multidimensional-optimization/)**
    
    ---
    
    You cannot optimize all dimensions simultaneously

- **[Law of Distributed Knowledge](distributed-knowledge/)**
    
    ---
    
    No single node can have complete, current knowledge

- **[Law of Cognitive Load](cognitive-load/)**
    
    ---
    
    Human understanding is the ultimate bottleneck

- **[Law of Economic Reality](economic-reality/)**
    
    ---
    
    Every technical decision has economic consequences

## Why These Laws Matter {#why-laws-matter}

Understanding these laws helps you:

- **Avoid impossible designs** — Don't fight physics
- **Make better trade-offs** — Know what you're sacrificing  
- **Predict failure modes** — Anticipate problems before they occur
- **Communicate effectively** — Explain constraints to stakeholders

## How to Study the Laws {#how-to-study}

1. **Read each law in order** — They build on each other
2. **Study the physics derivation** — Understand the "why"
3. **Review failure examples** — Learn from real disasters
4. **Apply to your systems** — Identify where laws apply
