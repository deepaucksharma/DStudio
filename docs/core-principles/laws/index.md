# The 7 Fundamental Laws

Immutable laws derived from physics that govern all distributed systems.

## Overview

These laws represent fundamental constraints that no amount of engineering can overcome. They are derived from the laws of physics - particularly the speed of light and thermodynamics - and shape every aspect of distributed system design.

## The Laws

1. **[Law of Correlated Failure](correlated-failure/)** - Failures in distributed systems are never independent
2. **[Law of Asynchronous Reality](asynchronous-reality/)** - Perfect synchronization is impossible in distributed systems
3. **[Law of Emergent Chaos](emergent-chaos/)** - Complex behaviors emerge from simple interactions
4. **[Law of Multidimensional Optimization](multidimensional-optimization/)** - You cannot optimize all dimensions simultaneously
5. **[Law of Distributed Knowledge](distributed-knowledge/)** - No single node can have complete, current knowledge
6. **[Law of Cognitive Load](cognitive-load/)** - Human understanding is the ultimate bottleneck
7. **[Law of Economic Reality](economic-reality/)** - Every technical decision has economic consequences

## Why These Laws Matter

Understanding these laws helps you:

- **Avoid impossible designs** - Don't fight physics
- **Make better trade-offs** - Know what you're sacrificing
- **Predict failure modes** - Anticipate problems before they occur
- **Communicate effectively** - Explain constraints to stakeholders

## How to Study the Laws

1. **Read each law in order** - They build on each other
2. **Study the physics derivation** - Understand the "why"
3. **Review failure examples** - Learn from real disasters
4. **Apply to your systems** - Identify where laws apply
