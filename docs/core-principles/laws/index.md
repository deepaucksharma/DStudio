# The 7 Fundamental Laws

> Immutable laws derived from physics that govern all distributed systems

## Start Here: Module 0 {#start-here}

> **🎯 Critical First Step:** Before diving into the laws, start with our learning methodology

**[📚 Module 0: How to Learn These Laws](module-0-how-to-learn.md)**

This module teaches you the Apex Learner's Protocol—the scientifically-proven approach that will help you master these fundamental laws in 30 days. Understanding how to learn effectively is more valuable than any single law.

## Overview {#overview}

These laws represent fundamental constraints that no amount of engineering can overcome. They are derived from the laws of physics—particularly the speed of light and thermodynamics—and shape every aspect of distributed system design.

**Why This Matters to You:** Every production outage, every performance bottleneck, every architectural decision you've struggled with—they all trace back to violations of these laws. Master them, and you'll see patterns everywhere.

## Quick Start Paths {#quick-start}

Choose your learning intensity:

### 🚀 "I Have 2 Hours" (Emergency Mode)
1. Read [Module 0](module-0-how-to-learn.md) (20 min)
2. Skim [Law of Correlated Failure](correlated-failure.md) + [Law of Cognitive Load](cognitive-load.md) (40 min)
3. Apply to your current crisis (60 min)

### ⚡ "I Have 1 Week" (Tactical Mastery)
- **Days 1-2:** Module 0 + Laws 1-2 with retrieval practice
- **Days 3-4:** Laws 3-4 + real-world application exercises
- **Days 5-6:** Laws 5-7 + case study analysis
- **Day 7:** Integration assessment and planning

### 🏆 "30-Day Mastery" (Strategic Depth)
- **Week 1:** Foundation (Module 0 + Laws 1-2)
- **Week 2:** Core Systems (Laws 3-5)
- **Week 3:** Human Factors (Laws 6-7)
- **Week 4:** Integration and real-world application
