# Temporal Constraints

Time in distributed systems is both essential and unreliable. Clocks drift, messages arrive out of order, and no global reference exists. These limitations form the temporal constraints that every architecture must respect.

## Clock Drift and Skew

Even atomic clocks diverge over time. Network Time Protocol (NTP) can reduce error but never eliminates it. Nodes must assume their local clocks are approximate and handle skew explicitly.

## Relative Ordering

Without a trusted global clock, events are ordered relative to one another. Logical clocks, vector clocks, and hybrid logical clocks provide partial ordering, but causality still requires explicit tracking.

## Practical Implications

- Perfect synchronization is unattainable; aim for bounded uncertainty instead.
- Timeout values must account for drift and network variability.
- Consensus algorithms rely on logical time to avoid false assumptions about order.

Understanding these limits helps engineers design systems that tolerate ambiguity and favor coordination mechanisms resilient to time's inherent uncertainty.
