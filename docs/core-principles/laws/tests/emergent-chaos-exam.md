## Section C: Hard Questions (60 minutes)

=== "L3-C-1: Thundering Herd"
    
    ### Task
    Define the term "thundering herd" in ≤25 words and name the single resource all requests synchronize on.
    
    ??? tip "Synchronization Point"
        What happens when many clients act simultaneously?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Definition:** Thundering herd = Many clients wake at the same moment and hammer the same cache/key/endpoint, collapsing it.
        
        **Shared Resource:** Usually a cache key, database row, or API endpoint that all clients need simultaneously.

=== "L3-C-2: Phase Transition Signal"
    
    ### Scenario
    Your queue depth graph suddenly shows a knee curve (flat → vertical rise) at 68% CPU.
    
    **Task:** What Law 3 concept does this signal and why?
    
    ??? tip "Non-Linear Behavior"
        What happens near 70% utilization?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Concept:** Critical point / Phase transition / Metastable onset
        
        **Why:** The sudden "knee" at ~70% CPU is the critical-point signature—the system crosses from linear to non-linear behavior. Small load additions now create huge backlogs. This is the phase transition where queueing delay becomes unbounded.

=== "L3-C-3: Retry Policy Danger"
    
    ### Scenario
    A retry policy has `maxAttempts = ∞, backoff = 0`.
    
    **Task:** Name the emergent failure pattern it creates and provide a one-line mitigation.
    
    ??? tip "Amplification Loop"
        What happens with infinite immediate retries?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Pattern:** Retry storm / Cascade failure
        
        **Mitigation:** Limit attempts + exponential backoff with jitter
        
        Example: `maxAttempts = 3, backoff = 2^n * 100ms + random(0, 100ms)`

=== "L3-C-4: Cron Synchronization"
    
    ### Task
    Explain in one sentence why perfect synchronization of cron jobs across hundreds of pods is dangerous near 70% load.
    
    ??? tip "Coherent Behavior"
        What does synchronization do to random noise?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Answer:** Near 70% load, perfectly aligned cron bursts convert random noise into coherent spikes, pushing the system past its phase transition point into chaos.
        
        The natural randomness that keeps systems stable is destroyed by synchronization.

=== "L3-C-5: Early Warning Metric"
    
    ### Scenario
    Choose the best early-warning metric for a system sliding into emergent chaos:
    - (A) Average CPU
    - (B) Variance of latency
    - (C) Number of pods
    
    **Task:** Pick one with brief justification.
    
    ??? tip "Leading Indicator"
        What changes first before collapse?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Answer: (B) Variance of latency**
        
        **Justification:** Variance spikes before averages move. High variance indicates the system is losing its damping ability—the first sign of approaching chaos. Average metrics lag behind actual instability.

=== "L3-C-6: Auto-scaling Trap"
    
    ### Scenario
    True/False: "If every microservice has identical auto-scaling rules, cascade risk is reduced."
    
    **Task:** Explain briefly.
    
    ??? tip "Coordinated Action"
        What happens when everyone scales together?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **False**
        
        **Explanation:** Identical rules make all services scale in lock-step → simultaneous pod churn across the system. This synchronized scaling amplifies feedback loops rather than dampening them. Different scaling triggers/thresholds would be safer.

=== "L3-C-7: Law Pairing"
    
    ### Task
    Which Specter of Correlated Failure pairs most naturally with Law 3 and why?
    (Blast, Cascade, Gray, Metastable, Common-Cause)
    
    ??? tip "Feedback Mechanisms"
        Which specter involves amplification?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Answer: Cascade**
        
        **Why:** Emergent chaos rides on positive feedback loops, and cascades are exactly such chained amplifications. Both involve small triggers creating massive, self-reinforcing failures through feedback mechanisms.

=== "L3-C-8: Breaking Synchronization"
    
    ### Task
    List two simple code-level techniques that break synchronization without changing business logic.
    
    ??? tip "Decorrelation Methods"
        How to make identical things act differently?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Techniques:**
        
        1. **Add random jitter:** 
        ```python
        sleep(base_time + random.uniform(-jitter, jitter))
        ```
        
        2. **Exponential backoff:**
        ```python
        delay = min(base * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)
        ```
        
        Others: Token bucket with relaxed refill, distributed locks with variable TTL, staggered cron schedules

## Section D: Very Hard Scenarios (90 minutes)

=== "L3-D-1: Retry Storm Autopsy"
    
    ### Challenge
    A payment API saw QPS jump 10× in 30s after a 502 blip.
    
    **Task:** Write a 150-word analysis that:
    1. Identifies the positive feedback loop
    2. Shows how it crossed the ~70% critical point
    3. Suggests two config tweaks to cap the surge
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Retry Storm Analysis (148 words):**
        
        A brief 502 from the payment gateway became a positive feedback loop: each client retried instantly, tripling load in one RTT. The extra traffic increased queue time, producing further 502s, causing more clients to retry. 
        
        At ~70% baseline CPU, the system hit the critical region described by Law 3—small perturbations create disproportionate effects. The retry amplification pushed utilization past 80%, where queueing delay becomes unbounded. QPS jumped 10× as every request generated multiple retries, creating a self-sustaining storm.
        
        **Config Fixes:**
        1. **Cap attempts with jitter:** `maxAttempts=3` with full-jitter exponential backoff starting at 250ms. This breaks synchronization and limits amplification.
        
        2. **Server-side rate limiting:** Add token bucket (250 req/s) returning 429 (not 502) when exhausted. This provides explicit backpressure signal, preventing further client retries.
        
        These changes prevent the positive feedback loop from forming, keeping the system below critical threshold.

=== "L3-D-2: Metastable Queue"
    
    ### Challenge
    Given: Worker pool fixed at 100 req/s, clients sending 90 req/s.
    
    **Part A:** Explain in ≤100 words why adding automatic retry after 2s can decrease throughput to 0.
    
    **Part B:** Sketch three-bullet escape plan (no code) to restore steady state without scaling.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Part A: Why Throughput Collapses (97 words):**
        
        Baseline 90 req/s < 100 capacity = stable. Adding mandatory retry after 2s effectively increases arrival rate. Once queue depth causes any request to wait >2s, it gets retried, adding to queue. This triggers more delays, more retries—a self-reinforcing loop. 
        
        Eventually, arrival rate = 90 (original) + 90 (retries) = 180 req/s, far exceeding 100 req/s capacity. Workers process only duplicates, making zero progress on new work. System enters metastable state: 100% busy, 0% useful throughput.
        
        **Part B: Escape Plan:**
        
        • **Pause retries when queue >N** - Implement backpressure to stop retry amplification
        
        • **Drop duplicates via idempotency keys** - Detect and discard retry of in-progress work
        
        • **Temporary degradation** - Serve cached/"please wait" responses until queue <50%

=== "L3-D-3: Chaos Dashboard"
    
    ### Challenge
    Design a 6-widget dashboard to warn engineers 5 minutes before Law 3 phase transition.
    
    For each widget specify:
    - The signal (e.g., "p99-p50 latency gap")
    - Why it leads actual collapse
    - Alert threshold (plain English)
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Chaos Early Warning Dashboard:**
        
        | Widget | Signal | Why It's Predictive | Alert Threshold |
        |--------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
        | **1. Latency Spread** | p99-p50 gap | Gap widens as tail grows before average moves | Gap >3× baseline |
        | **2. Retry Rate** | Retries/sec | Positive feedback loop indicator | >2% of total traffic |
        | **3. Queue Velocity** | Queue depth growth rate | Knee curve shows phase transition | Slope >2× baseline for 2min |
        | **4. CPU Acceleration** | dCPU/dt | Steep derivative precedes saturation | dCPU/dt >10%/min |
        | **5. GC Synchronization** | Concurrent GC count | Fleet-wide pauses indicate lock-step | >3/min on >50% pods |
        | **6. Traffic Variance** | Variance of ingress QPS | Loss of randomness → synchronization | Variance <20% of baseline |
        
        **Dashboard Philosophy:** Monitor derivatives and distributions, not just averages. Chaos shows in variance before means.

=== "L3-D-4: Feature Flag Disaster"
    
    ### Challenge
    Rolling a new JSON parser caused every service to restart within 45s, triggering a reboot loop.
    
    **Part A:** Tie this to Emergent Chaos law in one paragraph.
    
    **Part B:** Propose 5-bullet guard-rail rollout plan preventing synchronized restarts.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Part A: Emergent Chaos Connection:**
        
        The simultaneous rollout created a synchronization event: every pod restarted within the same 45s window. With baseline utilization at 65%, the coordinated loss of capacity drove the cluster past the 70% critical point. Queue depths exploded exponentially, and Kubernetes liveness probes—seeing unhealthy pods—killed them faster than they could recover. This created a positive feedback loop: restarts → reduced capacity → overload → health check failures → more restarts. Classic emergent chaos from synchronized behavior pushing the system into a metastable failure state.
        
        **Part B: Guard-Rail Rollout Plan:**
        
        • **10% canary batches** - Release to 10% of pods with 5-minute soak between waves
        
        • **Jittered restarts** - Add random ±60s delay to sidecar/pod restarts
        
        • **Circuit-breaker flag** - Auto-halt rollout if error rate doubles
        
        • **Deployment constraints** - Set max-unavailable ≤5% in deployment spec
        
        • **P99-P50 monitoring** - Auto-pause when latency spread exceeds threshold

## Study Tips

!!! tip "Key Concepts to Master"
    1. **Critical Threshold ~70%**
       - Phase transitions happen here
       - Linear → exponential behavior
       - Small changes → huge impacts
    
    2. **Feedback Loops**
       - Positive amplifies (bad)
       - Negative dampens (good)
       - Identify and break them
    
    3. **Synchronization = Danger**
       - Correlation increases near critical point
       - Always add jitter
       - Stagger everything
    
    4. **Early Warning Signs**
       - Variance increases first
       - Tail latency grows
       - Watch derivatives, not averages
