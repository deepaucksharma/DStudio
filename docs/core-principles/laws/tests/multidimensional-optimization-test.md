# Law 4: The Law of Multidimensional Optimization

‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 30 minutes | üìù **30 questions** | ‚úÖ **Passing:** 75%

!!! abstract "Core Principle"
    You cannot optimize everything simultaneously. Every distributed system design involves trading off latency, throughput, consistency, availability, and cost.

What's the typical cost multiplier for each additional "9" of availability?

### 17. [Identify Failure] Trade-off Violation
Scenario: "System guarantees <1ms latency, 100% consistency, across global regions"
- **Answer:** Physically impossible due to speed of light

### 18. [Multiple Choice] Batch Size Optimization
Increasing batch size generally:
- A) Reduces latency, reduces throughput
- B) Reduces latency, increases throughput
- C) Increases latency, increases throughput ‚úì
- D) Increases latency, reduces throughput

### 19. [Fill in Blank] Consistency Window

Match use case to acceptable trade-off:
1. Social media likes     A. Eventual consistency OK
2. Bank transfers         B. Strong consistency required
3. Product catalog        C. Read-optimized, stale OK
4. Stock trading          D. Low latency critical

**Answers:** 1-A, 2-B, 3-C, 4-D

## Quick Reference Card

### The Trade-off Matrix

| If You Want... | You Must Accept... |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Strong Consistency** | Higher latency, lower availability |
| **High Availability** | Eventual consistency, split-brain risk |
| **Low Latency** | Local decisions, potential inconsistency |
| **High Throughput** | Batching delays, higher latency |
| **Low Cost** | Reduced redundancy, lower availability |

### Common Optimization Patterns

1. **Read-Heavy:** Multiple replicas, caching, eventual consistency
2. **Write-Heavy:** Sharding, async processing, write buffers
3. **Global Scale:** Regional partitions, eventual consistency, CDNs
4. **Financial:** Strong consistency, higher costs, lower throughput
5. **Analytics:** Batch processing, eventual consistency, high throughput

### Remember
- **You can't have it all** - every choice has a trade-off
- **Optimize for your use case** - not all systems need strong consistency
- **Cost is a dimension too** - technical excellence must be economically viable
- **Measure and iterate** - trade-offs change as systems evolve
