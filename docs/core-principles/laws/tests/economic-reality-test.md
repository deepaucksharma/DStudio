‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 30 minutes | üìù **30 questions** | ‚úÖ **Passing:** 75%

!!! abstract "Core Principle"
    Technical excellence must be economically viable. Every architectural decision has a cost, and perfection is economically impossible.

## Quick Reference Card

### Cost Scaling Factors

| Factor | Typical Impact |
|--------|---------------|
| **Each 9 of availability** | 10x cost |
| **Multi-region** | 2-3x cost |
| **Strong consistency** | 2-5x cost |
| **Real-time processing** | 3-10x cost |
| **Zero downtime deployment** | 2-4x complexity cost |

### ROI Calculations

```
ROI = (Benefit - Cost) / Cost √ó 100%

Developer Hour = Annual Salary / 2000
Downtime Cost = Revenue per Hour √ó Hours Down
Automation ROI = (Time Saved √ó Hourly Rate) - Development Cost
```

### Cost Optimization Hierarchy

1. **Eliminate waste:** Unused resources, overprovisioning
2. **Optimize usage:** Right-sizing, scheduling
3. **Leverage discounts:** Reserved capacity, spot instances
4. **Architectural changes:** Caching, async processing
5. **Renegotiate contracts:** Volume discounts, commitments

### Economic Principles

- **Diminishing returns:** Each improvement costs more
- **Opportunity cost:** Consider alternatives
- **Total cost of ownership:** Include operational costs
- **Time value:** Earlier savings worth more
- **Risk-adjusted returns:** Factor in probability

### Remember
- **Perfect is the enemy of good** - And economically impossible
- **Measure ROI** - Not all improvements are worth it
- **Technical debt has interest** - Pay it strategically
- **People cost more than servers** - Optimize developer productivity
