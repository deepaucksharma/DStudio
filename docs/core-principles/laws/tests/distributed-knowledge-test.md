‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 30 minutes | üìù **30 questions** | ‚úÖ **Passing:** 75%

## Quick Reference Card

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Impact on Knowledge |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Network Delay** | Information always outdated by propagation time |
| **Partial Failure** | Different nodes see different failures |
| **Network Partition** | Splits system into isolated knowledge domains |
| **Byzantine Faults** | Nodes may lie about their knowledge |
| **Consensus** | Agreement despite partial knowledge |

### Common Patterns

1. **Gossip Protocol:** Probabilistic information spread
2. **Consensus Algorithm:** Agreement on shared state
3. **Vector Clocks:** Track causal relationships
4. **Heartbeats:** Detect liveness
5. **Service Discovery:** Track membership changes

### Design Principles

- **Assume partial knowledge** - Design for incomplete information
- **Make local decisions** - Don't wait for global state
- **Use timeouts** - Bound waiting for knowledge
- **Cache with TTL** - Accept controlled staleness
- **Implement consensus carefully** - It's expensive

### Remember
- **No node knows everything** - Design for partial knowledge
- **Information has latency** - Knowledge is always somewhat stale
- **Consensus is expensive** - Use it only when necessary
- **Local decisions scale** - Global coordination doesn't
