## Section 1: Hard-B Questions (75 minutes)

=== "HB-1: Latency Sanity Check"
    
    ### Scenario
    An API in Tokyo calls a service in Sydney (7,800 km fiber). A junior claims *sub-5ms* RTT is achievable if they "optimize TCP".
    
    **Task:** Quote the relevant law and one-line inequality that disproves the claim.
    
    ??? tip "Physics Hint"
        Remember the speed of light in fiber optic cables...
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Law of Asynchronous Reality:** `latency ≥ distance/c`
        
        **Calculation:**
        - Distance: 7,800 km
        - Speed of light in fiber: ~200,000 km/s (0.67c)
        - One-way minimum: 7,800 ÷ 200,000 = 39ms
        - **RTT minimum: 78ms**
        
        **Conclusion:** Sub-5ms RTT violates physics. No amount of TCP optimization can overcome the speed of light.

=== "HB-2: False Security"
    
    ### Scenario
    A diagram shows three microservices all pulling from a single Kafka topic. A yellow note says "No SPOF because Kafka is clustered."
    
    **Task:** State one reason the note is wrong, referencing a law.
    
    ??? tip "Correlation Hint"
        What do all three services depend on simultaneously?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Law 1 (Correlated Failure):** Despite Kafka being clustered, all three services share:
        
        - **Common control plane** (ZooKeeper/KRaft consensus)
        - **Same topic metadata** (partition leadership)
        - **Shared broker dependencies** (network, DNS)
        
        **Result:** ρ ≈ 0.9 (high correlation). A control plane failure or topic corruption affects all three services simultaneously = Common Cause failure pattern.

=== "HB-3: Retry Amplification"
    
    ### Scenario
    "We added aggressive client-side retries to improve reliability."
    
    **Task:** Name the emergent failure pattern this can create and its root cause.
    
    ??? tip "Feedback Loop"
        What happens when many clients retry simultaneously?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Pattern:** Retry Storm / Cascading Failure
        
        **Root Cause:** Positive feedback loop
        - Service slows down → Timeouts increase
        - Clients retry aggressively → Load multiplies
        - Higher load → Service slower
        - Creates **metastable state** where retry traffic prevents recovery
        
        **Law:** Emergent Chaos - simple retry rule creates complex system-wide failure

=== "HB-4: Gray Failure Detection"
    
    ### Scenario
    Pick the **best** health metric to catch a gray failure in a read-through cache:
    - (A) Cache hit-ratio
    - (B) p99 user latency  
    - (C) CPU on cache nodes
    
    **Task:** Choose one and explain in one sentence.
    
    ??? tip "User Impact"
        Which metric directly reflects user experience?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Answer: B - p99 user latency**
        
        **Explanation:** User latency reveals hidden stalls (lock contention, network delays, slow cache misses) even when hit-ratio looks "green" and CPU appears normal - it's the only metric that captures end-to-end user pain.
        
        Gray failures hide from infrastructure metrics but can't hide from user-facing latency.

=== "HB-5: Consistency Trade-offs"
    
    ### Scenario
    Your feed service moves from strong to eventual consistency.
    
    **Task:** List **one user-visible symptom** and **one compensating UX pattern**.
    
    ??? tip "Time Travel"
        What happens when different replicas have different states?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **User-Visible Symptom:**
        Out-of-order likes/comments - user sees their like disappear then reappear, or sees comment count go backwards
        
        **Compensating UX Pattern:**
        - **"Last updated just now"** indicator showing data freshness
        - **Pull-to-refresh** gesture for user-initiated consistency
        - **Optimistic UI** - show user's own actions immediately
        
        **Law:** Distributed Knowledge - no single source of truth means temporal inconsistencies

=== "HB-6: Timeout Physics"
    
    ### Scenario
    State the single-sentence rule that links **physics** and **timeout budgets** from Law 2.
    
    ??? tip "Round Trip"
        Don't forget both directions...
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Rule:** `Timeout ≥ (2 × distance/c) + processing_p99`
        
        **Explanation:** Timeouts must respect:
        1. Physics minimum (2× for round trip)
        2. Plus realistic processing time (p99 not average)
        3. Plus buffer for network variability
        
        Setting timeout < physical minimum guarantees 100% timeout rate.

=== "HB-7: Alert Quality"
    
    ### Scenario
    Which **two alert-quality criteria** (of the 5) are most often violated by auto-generated CloudWatch alarms?
    
    **Task:** Name them and explain why they overload humans.
    
    ??? tip "3 AM Test"
        Would you want to be woken up for this?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Most Violated Criteria:**
        
        1. **Non-Actionable** - "CPU at 71%" doesn't tell you what to DO
        2. **Non-Unique** - 50 identical "high latency" alerts from same root cause
        
        **Why They Overload:**
        - Require human to figure out action (cognitive load)
        - Create alert fatigue through redundancy
        - Violate the "wake me up only if I can fix it" principle
        
        **Law:** Cognitive Load - bad alerts increase mental burden exponentially

=== "HB-8: Sharding Myths"
    
    ### Scenario
    True/False: "If I shard my database by customer-ID I automatically eliminate correlated failures."
    
    **Task:** Answer with justification (≤40 words).
    
    ??? tip "Hidden Dependencies"
        What else do shards share besides data?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **False** 
        
        Sharding only partitions data, not dependencies. All shards still share:
        - Metadata service (shard routing)
        - Network infrastructure
        - Backup/replication systems
        - Schema migrations
        - Monitoring plane
        
        Any shared component creates correlation (ρ > 0).

=== "HB-9: Less is More"
    
    ### Scenario
    Give one example where spending *less* money increases overall reliability.
    
    **Task:** Cite the Law of Economic Reality.
    
    ??? tip "Complexity Cost"
        Sometimes removing things helps...
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Example:** Removing an under-utilized region
        
        - **Saves:** $50K/month in infrastructure
        - **Improves reliability:** Fewer moving parts, simpler deployments, less cross-region complexity
        - **Reduces:** Configuration drift, operational overhead, failure surface
        
        **Law of Economic Reality:** Complexity has a cost; sometimes the most expensive solution (multi-region) creates more problems than it solves for low-traffic scenarios.

=== "HB-10: Impossible Requirements"
    
    ### Scenario
    "Our REST API must hit 50ms p95 but we also demand 6 nines availability on the same infra."
    
    **Task:** Identify the multidimensional conflict in one sentence.
    
    ??? tip "Resource Budget"
        What would each goal require individually?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Conflict:** Achieving 50ms p95 requires aggressive timeouts and fast-failing, while 6 nines demands extensive retries and failover paths - optimizing both simultaneously under a fixed resource budget violates the Law of Multidimensional Optimization.
        
        (Low latency wants to fail fast; high availability wants to retry forever)

## Section 2: Very-Hard-B Scenarios (150 minutes)

=== "VHB-1: Split-Brain Drill"
    
    ### Challenge
    A sudden WAN cut isolates Region A (60% traffic) and Region B (40%). Both keep accepting writes.
    
    **Task 1:** Explain in ≤120 words why a *single* numeric version counter cannot guarantee convergence.
    
    **Task 2:** Propose a two-piece metadata scheme that *does* guarantee deterministic merge.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Why Single Counter Fails:**
        
        During partition, both regions increment the same counter independently:
        - Region A: v100 → v101 → v102
        - Region B: v100 → v101 → v102
        
        After healing, both have "v102" but with different data. No way to determine:
        - Which v102 is "correct"
        - What operations happened in what order
        - How to merge divergent states
        
        The counter provides no causality information - it's just a number without context.
        
        **Two-Piece Solution:**
        
        1. **Vector Clock:** `{regionA: 102, regionB: 47}`
           - Each region only increments its own counter
           - Preserves causality and concurrent operation detection
        
        2. **Operation Log Hash:** SHA256 of ordered operations
           - Detects if same version has different history
           - Enables deterministic conflict resolution
        
        Together: Can detect concurrent updates and apply deterministic merge strategy (e.g., LWW with region precedence).

=== "VHB-2: Cell Architecture Trap"
    
    ### Challenge
    Marketing wants a "flash-sale leaderboard" updated in real-time across all five independent cells (≤20% traffic each).
    
    **Task 1:** Draw or bullet the **undesired coupling** this feature introduces.
    
    **Task 2:** Offer **one server-side and one client-side** alternative that keeps cells independent.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Undesired Coupling:**
        ```
        Before: [Cell1] [Cell2] [Cell3] [Cell4] [Cell5]
                 20%     20%     20%     20%     20%
                 ρ ≈ 0 (independent)
        
        After:  [Cell1]→┐
                [Cell2]→├→[Global Leaderboard]←─┐
                [Cell3]→┤  (Shared State/API)   │
                [Cell4]→┤                       │
                [Cell5]→┘                       │
                         ρ = 1.0 (perfect correlation)
        ```
        
        **Problem:** Single leaderboard = common cause failure point. If it fails, 100% of users lose feature.
        
        **Server-Side Alternative:**
        - Each cell maintains local leaderboard
        - Background job aggregates into eventual-consistent view
        - Cells exchange deltas via async message queue
        - Each cell serves its cached version of global state
        - Failure impact: Stale data, not total loss
        
        **Client-Side Alternative:**
        - Client fetches top-10 from its assigned cell
        - Also fetches global winner from CDN (updated every 30s)
        - Merges in UI: "You: #3 in region | Global leader: XYZ"
        - Progressive enhancement - works even if global fetch fails

=== "VHB-3: Cost-Chaos Dilemma"
    
    ### Challenge
    CFO demands 30% infrastructure cost cut. Engineer suggests auto-scaling down to 85% CPU baseline.
    
    **Task:** Using at least **two laws**, explain why 85% risks emergent chaos. Offer safer target with justification.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Why 85% CPU is Dangerous:**
        
        **Law 1 - Emergent Chaos:**
        - Systems exhibit phase transitions around 70-80% utilization
        - At 85%, minor traffic spikes trigger queueing delays
        - Queueing delay grows non-linearly: `delay ∝ ρ/(1-ρ)`
        - At 85% util: 1/(1-0.85) = 6.7x baseline delay
        - Creates positive feedback: delays → timeouts → retries → more load
        
        **Law 2 - Economic Reality:**
        - Saving 30% on compute might cost 300% in incident response
        - One outage from resource exhaustion wipes out months of savings
        - False economy - operational costs exceed infrastructure savings
        
        **Law 3 - Cognitive Load:**
        - Operating at 85% means constant firefighting
        - Engineers can't think strategically when always in crisis
        - Burnout and attrition costs exceed infrastructure savings
        
        **Safer Target: 65-70% baseline**
        - Below chaos threshold
        - 2x headroom for spikes
        - Achieve 30% savings through:
          - Right-sizing instances (vertical optimization)
          - Sunset unused features
          - Data retention policies
          - Not through dangerous utilization levels

=== "VHB-4: Physics-Aware Feature Flag"
    
    ### Challenge
    You plan to roll out a feature flag to 300 edge locations "simultaneously" at 12:00 UTC.
    
    **Task 1:** State the physics-based reason true simultaneity is impossible.
    
    **Task 2:** Design a **three-step rollout protocol** that respects light-cone causality yet achieves "near-simultaneous" behavior.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Physics-Based Impossibility:**
        
        **Relativity of Simultaneity:** There is no universal "now" across distributed space. Information travels at maximum speed c, creating light-cones of causality. An event at edge location A cannot influence location B faster than distance/c. For global distribution:
        - Maximum separation: ~20,000km (opposite sides of Earth)
        - Minimum propagation: 67ms (at speed of light)
        - With realistic networks: 200-300ms
        - "12:00 UTC" arrives at different absolute times
        
        **Three-Step Protocol:**
        
        **Step 1: Pre-positioning (T-5 minutes)**
        ```yaml
        - Send encrypted flag state to all edges
        - Include activation_timestamp: "12:00:00.000Z"
        - Edges acknowledge receipt but don't activate
        ```
        
        **Step 2: Local clock activation (T=0)**
        ```yaml
        - Each edge activates based on LOCAL clock reaching timestamp
        - Use NTP-synchronized time (accuracy ±10ms)
        - Log activation with local timestamp + monotonic counter
        ```
        
        **Step 3: Reconciliation (T+1 minute)**
        ```yaml
        - Edges report actual activation time to coordinator
        - Identify outliers (>100ms deviation)
        - Send corrections to maintain consistency
        ```
        
        **Result:** Perceived simultaneity within 10-50ms despite physical impossibility of true simultaneity.
