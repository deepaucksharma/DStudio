# Law 2 Mastery Exam: Asynchronous Reality

!!! warning "Exam Instructions"
    **Format:** Open book | **Calculator:** Not needed
    
    - Focus on **conceptual understanding** of time and causality
    - Apply the simple relation: `latency ≥ distance/c` where c ≈ 200,000 km/s in fiber
    - Timeout rule: `timeout_parent ≥ timeout_child + 2×(distance/c) + processing_p99`
    - No heavy calculations required

## Quick Reference

!!! info "Core Formulas"
    - **Physical Limit:** `one-way latency ≥ distance / 200,000 km/s`
    - **Round Trip Time:** `RTT ≥ 2 × (distance / c)`
    - **Timeout Budget:** `parent_timeout ≥ child_timeout + RTT + processing`
    - **Clock Skew:** NTP typically ±10-50ms, even with good sync

## Section A: Hard Questions (60 minutes)

=== "L2-A-1: Physical Reality Check"
    
    ### Scenario
    A colleague claims a write-through cache in Frankfurt can confirm writes to a primary in Sydney "within 20ms" using gRPC.
    
    **Task:** State the single-line inequality that disproves this and give the minimal physical one-way latency.
    
    ??? tip "Distance Hint"
        Frankfurt to Sydney is approximately 16,600 km
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Inequality:** `latency ≥ distance/c`
        
        **Calculation:**
        - Distance: 16,600 km
        - Speed in fiber: 200,000 km/s
        - **Minimum one-way: 16,600 / 200,000 = 83ms**
        
        **Conclusion:** 20ms is physically impossible. The claim violates the speed of light by a factor of 4.

=== "L2-A-2: Global Simultaneity"
    
    ### Scenario
    Explain in ≤30 words why "cronjob at 00:00 UTC exactly everywhere" is unattainable.
    
    ??? tip "Think Physics"
        What does "exactly" mean across space?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Answer:** No global "now" exists; signals propagate at ≤c, creating inherent delays. Even with perfect clocks, the command to "start now" takes time to reach each server.
        
        (Alternative: "Simultaneity is relative; information cannot travel faster than light, making synchronized global actions physically impossible.")

=== "L2-A-3: Clock Skew Impact"
    
    ### Scenario
    Your two data centers have clock skew of 120ms. Name one real failure this can cause in an OAuth flow.
    
    ??? tip "Token Validation"
        What happens when timestamps disagree?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Failure:** Token appears expired or not-yet-valid
        
        **Example:**
        - DC1 issues token at "12:00:00" (valid for 300s)
        - DC2 clock reads "12:00:02" (120ms ahead)
        - User immediately uses token at DC2
        - DC2 sees token from "future" or already expired
        - **Result:** Legitimate users rejected with "invalid token" errors

=== "L2-A-4: Heartbeat Physics"
    
    ### Scenario
    Pick the better heartbeat interval for an East↔West US link (4,000 km): **15ms or 150ms?**
    
    **Task:** Give one-sentence justification.
    
    ??? tip "Minimum RTT"
        What's physically possible?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Answer: 150ms**
        
        **Justification:** 15ms < minimum RTT of 40ms (2 × 4,000/200,000), guaranteeing false-positive "node dead" alerts since no heartbeat can physically arrive in time.

=== "L2-A-5: Retry Amplification"
    
    ### Scenario
    Why does adding a single retry with no jitter sometimes increase average user latency by >100%?
    
    ??? tip "Cascading Effects"
        What happens to the total path?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Three Compounding Effects:**
        
        1. **Doubles path length** - user waits for original + retry
        2. **Adds queueing delay** - retry arrives when system busier
        3. **Amplifies light-cone delay** - each attempt faces physical limits
        
        **Example:** 50ms request becomes 50ms + timeout + 50ms + queue = 150ms+ total

=== "L2-A-6: HLC Dependencies"
    
    ### Scenario
    True/False: "Hybrid Logical Clocks eliminate the need for NTP once deployed."
    
    **Task:** Explain your answer.
    
    ??? tip "Physical Component"
        What's the "hybrid" part of HLC?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **False**
        
        **Explanation:** HLCs combine physical time + logical counter. They still need bounded physical clock skew as input. Without NTP keeping physical clocks reasonably close, the physical component diverges unboundedly, breaking the "hybrid" nature and approximate wall-clock correlation.

=== "L2-A-7: Causality Metadata"
    
    ### Scenario
    List two metadata fields you must attach to every cross-region message to preserve causality under asynchronous reality.
    
    ??? tip "Ordering Information"
        What lets you reconstruct happens-before?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Required Fields:**
        
        1. **Logical/Vector timestamp** - Captures causality (e.g., `{region_A: 42, region_B: 17}`)
        2. **Sender node/region ID** - Identifies source for vector clock updates
        
        (Alternative: HLC tuple containing both physical and logical components)

=== "L2-A-8: Vector Clock Advantage"
    
    ### Scenario
    Give one reason vector clocks are preferred over wall-clock timestamps for conflict resolution in eventually-consistent stores.
    
    ??? tip "Causality vs Time"
        What do vector clocks capture that timestamps don't?
    
    ??? success "Expected Answer"
        **Answer:** Vector clocks capture happens-before relationships without relying on synchronized physical clocks.
        
        **Key Advantage:** Can definitively determine if events are causally related or concurrent, enabling correct conflict resolution even with arbitrary clock skew. Wall clocks can't distinguish "happened-before" from "clock was slow."

## Section B: Very Hard Scenarios (90 minutes)

=== "L2-B-1: Physics-Aware Consensus"
    
    ### Challenge
    Design a **three-step leader election protocol** that refuses to elect if any vote arrives faster than `distance_estimate/c`.
    
    **Deliverable:** Sequence diagram and ≤150 words on how this prevents "time-paradox" elections.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Protocol Design:**
        
        ```
        Step 1: Announce Candidacy
        Candidate → All: "ELECT_ME" + timestamp + location
                        
        Step 2: Vote Collection with Physics Check  
        Voter:
          on receive(ELECT_ME, T_sent, location):
            T_received = now()
            distance = estimate_distance(location)
            min_time = distance / 200,000  # km/s
            
            if (T_received - T_sent) < min_time:
              REJECT  # Impossibly fast = clock skew
            else:
              VOTE
        
        Step 3: Tally with Quorum
        Candidate:
          if votes > N/2 AND no_physics_violations:
            BECOME_LEADER
          else:
            BACKOFF(random_delay)
            RETRY
        ```
        
        **Prevention Mechanism (147 words):**
        
        This protocol prevents "time-paradox" elections where a future leader appears elected before the election started. By rejecting votes that arrive faster than light-speed, we detect severe clock skew that could cause:
        
        1. A candidate with future-dated clock winning unfairly
        2. Votes being counted before they were cast
        3. Split-brain from disagreement about election timing
        
        The physics check acts as a "clock skew detector." If a message arrives impossibly fast, either the sender's clock is in the future or the receiver's is in the past. Either way, they shouldn't participate in consensus.
        
        The random backoff prevents thundering herd when multiple candidates detect violations. By falling back to longer timeouts, we maintain liveness while ensuring only nodes with reasonable clock sync can become leaders.
        
        This trades some availability (rejected elections) for safety (no paradox leaders).

=== "L2-B-2: Global Feature Flag"
    
    ### Challenge
    You must roll out a feature to **300 edge POPs** "simultaneously."
    
    **Task:** Draft a bullet-list rollout plan (max 6 bullets) that:
    1. Guarantees no POP acts >5s before the configured moment
    2. Avoids all-or-nothing correlated failure
    
    Mention the formula used for propagation buffers.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Rollout Plan:**
        
        • **Pre-stage at T-60s:** Push encrypted feature flag to all POPs with `activation_time = T₀ + 5s` (buffer for propagation)
        
        • **Calculate buffer:** Use `buffer = max_distance/c + 2σ_clock_skew + 1s` where max_distance = 20,000km (opposite Earth)
        
        • **Staged activation:** POPs activate based on `local_clock ≥ activation_time`, not on receiving signal (avoids cascade)
        
        • **Canary POPs:** 5% activate at T₀, 25% at T₀+1s, 70% at T₀+2s (limits blast radius if flag is bad)
        
        • **Local circuit breaker:** Each POP monitors local error rate; auto-disables flag if errors >10% (prevents correlated failure)
        
        • **Heartbeat confirmation:** POPs report actual activation time to coordinator; any >5s deviation triggers investigation
        
        **Formula:** `min_buffer = 20,000km / 200,000km/s = 100ms` + clock skew allowance

=== "L2-B-3: Timeout Budget Table"
    
    ### Challenge
    Fill in the timeout values ensuring `parent ≥ child + 2×(distance/c) + proc_p99`:
    
    | Component | Distance | Processing P99 | Timeout | Calculation |
    |-----------|----------|---------------|---------|-------------|
    | API Gateway → Service | 300 km | 10ms | ? | ? |
    | Service → DB | 30 km | 5ms | ? | ? |
    | DB → Replica | 1 km | 2ms | 50ms | (given) |
    
    **Task:** Complete the table and state the user-visible SLA achieved.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Completed Table:**
        
        | Component | Distance | RTT Min | Proc P99 | Timeout | Calculation |
        |-----------|----------|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
        | DB → Replica | 1 km | 0.01ms | 2ms | 50ms | (given baseline) |
        | Service → DB | 30 km | 0.3ms | 5ms | **56ms** | 50 + 0.3 + 5 = 55.3 → 56ms |
        | API Gateway → Service | 300 km | 3ms | 10ms | **70ms** | 56 + 3 + 10 = 69 → 70ms |
        
        **Calculations:**
        - DB→Replica RTT: 2 × (1/200,000) = 0.01ms
        - Service→DB RTT: 2 × (30/200,000) = 0.3ms  
        - Gateway→Service RTT: 2 × (300/200,000) = 3ms
        
        **User-Visible SLA:** 70ms timeout at API Gateway level, meaning **p99 latency ≤ 70ms** for successful requests.

=== "L2-B-4: Split-Brain Post-Mortem"
    
    ### Challenge
    Write a **200-word incident report** explaining how a 75ms one-way WAN spike caused dual-primary writes even though HAProxy health checks ran every 10s.
    
    **Task:** Identify the flawed assumption about simultaneity and propose one config change.
    
    ??? example "Model Answer"
        **Incident Report: Split-Brain Due to WAN Latency Spike**
        
        **What Happened:**
        At 14:23 UTC, a 75ms WAN latency spike between DC-A and DC-B triggered a split-brain condition where both databases promoted themselves to primary, accepting writes for 47 seconds.
        
        **Root Cause:**
        HAProxy health checks every 10s seemed sufficient, but we failed to account for asynchronous reality. The 75ms spike meant:
        
        1. DC-A detected DC-B as "down" (health check timeout was 50ms)
        2. DC-A promoted itself to primary at T+0
        3. DC-B detected DC-A as "down" simultaneously 
        4. DC-B promoted itself to primary at T+0
        5. Both sent "I'm primary" messages that took 75ms to arrive
        6. Each received the other's claim 75ms later, creating conflict
        
        **Flawed Assumption:**
        We assumed health check failures would be detected "simultaneously" and one would yield. Reality: there's no simultaneous in distributed systems. Each side made decisions based on local incomplete information.
        
        **Fix:**
        Change HAProxy timeout from 50ms to 200ms (accounting for `timeout ≥ 2×distance/c + buffer`). For 3,000km separation: minimum 30ms RTT + 170ms buffer for WAN variance.
        
        **Prevention:**
        Implement proper distributed consensus (Raft/Paxos) instead of timeout-based leadership.
