# Revised Test Implementation Strategy: Objective Assessment Focus

## Core Principle: Quick, Objective Assessments Only

All tests should consist of:
- **Multiple choice questions** (A/B/C/D)
- **True/False with brief justification** (‚â§25 words)
- **Fill in the blank** (single word/phrase)
- **One-line answers** (‚â§1 sentence)
- **Match the pattern** (connect concepts)
- **Choose the best option** (from list)

**NO:** Long essays, coding exercises, complex scenarios requiring paragraph answers

## Question Distribution Guidelines

### Per Law/Pillar Test Module

| Question Type | Count | Time (sec/question) | Example |
|--------------|-------|---------------------|---------|
| Multiple Choice | 10-12 | 30 | Choose best pattern |
| True/False + Reason | 5-6 | 45 | Statement validation |
| Fill in Blank | 3-4 | 20 | Terms/formulas |
| One-line Answer | 5-6 | 45 | Define/explain |
| Pattern Match | 2-3 | 60 | Connect concepts |
| Rank/Order | 2-3 | 60 | Prioritize options |
| **Total** | **30-35** | **~20 min** | |

## Implementation Changes Needed

### For Existing Laws 1-3

**Current Structure:**
- Long scenarios with detailed explanations
- Multi-paragraph answers
- Complex analysis questions

**Revised Structure:**
- Break scenarios into multiple choice
- Convert analyses to true/false
- Simplify to one-line answers

### Example Conversion

**Original (Law 1):**
```
Q: Explain why "independent" systems aren't really independent 
   and how this affects availability calculations.
[Expected: 3-paragraph answer about correlation]
```

**Revised:**
```
Q1: True/False: Two servers in the same rack have correlation coefficient near zero.
Answer: False - Same rack œÅ ‚âà 0.9

Q2: If two 99.9% available services have œÅ=0.9, what's real availability?
A) 99.99%  B) 99.9%  C) ~90%  D) ~10% ‚úì

Q3: Name the primary cause of correlation between services.
Answer: Shared dependencies
```
