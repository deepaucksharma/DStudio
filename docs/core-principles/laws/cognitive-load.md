# Law 6: The Law of Cognitive Load - Your Humans Are Not Machines

!!! quote "The Human Truth That Changes Everything"
    **Your engineers are not servers. They don't scale horizontally. They have 7±2 slots of working memory, not 64GB of RAM. They need sleep, not just disk space. When you design systems that ignore human limits, you design systems that fail.**

### The Physics of Human Cognition

**Fundamental Limit**: Just as Shannon proved channels have finite capacity, Miller proved human working memory has hard limits:
- **Working Memory**: 7 ± 2 items (not bytes, but meaningful chunks)
- **Conscious Processing**: ~50 bits/second (vs unconscious: ~11 million bits/s)
- **Attention**: Single-threaded processor with expensive context switching

**Stress Degradation**:
```
Under stress: Capacity = Normal_Capacity × e^(-stress_level)
At 3 AM: Effective_chunks ≈ 3-4 (not 7)
Under pressure: Error_rate = 1 - e^(-cognitive_load/capacity)
```

August 1, 2012 - Knight Capital Trading Floor
═══════════════════════════════════════════

What the Engineers Faced:
• 8 servers in mixed states
• 3 different code versions
• 6,561 possible combinations
• 7±2 human memory slots
• 45 minutes to understand
• $10 million lost per minute

The Human Breaking Point:
09:30 - "Something's wrong"
09:35 - "I can't track all the states"
09:40 - "Which version is where?"
09:45 - Complete cognitive collapse
10:15 - Company destroyed

Not a technical failure. A human design failure.
```

### Three Mile Island - Interface Design Failure (1979)

What the Operators Faced:
• 100+ alarms sounding simultaneously
• Contradictory indicators
• Valve position showing "command sent" not "actual position"
• No alarm prioritization
• Critical warnings lost in noise

## The Five Ways We Break Our Humans (With Solutions)

### 1. Mental Model Impossibility → Cognitive Boundaries

```
THE PROBLEM                    THE SOLUTION
═══════════                    ════════════
173 microservices       →      5-7 service groups
2,847 dependencies      →      Hierarchical ownership
"It's complicated"      →      Visual system maps

Implementation (Team Topologies Pattern):
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stream Team A: User Experience   │
│ └─ Owns: Login, Profile, Settings│
│ Platform Team B: Data Layer      │
│ └─ Owns: DB, Cache, Message Bus │
│ Enabling Team C: Tooling         │
│ └─ Owns: Deploy, Monitor, Debug  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Alert Fatigue → Smart Alert Design

```
ALERT QUALITY SCORING SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════

For each alert, score 1-5:
☐ Actionable? (Can I fix it?)
☐ Urgent? (Must I fix it now?)
☐ Unique? (Not duplicate?)
☐ Clear? (Do I know how?)
☐ Accurate? (Not false positive?)

Score <20: DELETE IT
Score 20-23: Improve it
Score 24-25: Keep it

Progression Example:
Day 1:    1,247 alerts → Chaos
Week 1:   Apply scoring → 423 remain
Week 2:   Group related → 89 remain
Week 3:   Add context → 89 actionable
Result:   93% reduction, 100% quality
```

### 3. Dashboard Overload → Progressive Disclosure

```
FROM CHAOS TO CLARITY
════════════════════

Before: 47 dashboards × 20 metrics = 940 signals
After:  1 overview + 3 drill-downs = 4 total

The 3-Level Architecture:
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ L1: Business Health (1 screen) │
│ ├─ Users impacted: 0.3%       │
│ └─ Revenue impact: $0         │
│ L2: Service Status (3 screens)│
│ ├─ Frontend: 🟢               │
│ ├─ API: 🟡                    │
│ └─ Database: 🔴              │
│ L3: Deep Dive (on demand)     │
│ └─ Metrics, logs, traces      │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. The Stress Multiplier → Stress-Proof Design

```
COGNITIVE CAPACITY UNDER STRESS
══════════════════════════════

Normal brain: 7±2 items ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░
3 AM brain:   2-3 items ▓▓▓░░░░░░

Solution: Binary Decision Trees
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Is site up? [🟢 YES] [🔴 NO]  │
│     ↓              ↓           │
│ Monitor only   Is it DB?       │
│                [🟢][🔴]        │
│                 ↓    ↓         │
│              [FIX] Check API   │
└─────────────────────────────┘

No thinking. Just clicking.
```

### 5. The "Hero" Trap → Collective Ownership

```
FROM HERO TO TEAM
════════════════

Before: "Only Sarah knows X"
│
After: Team Ownership Model
│
├─ Primary: Sarah
├─ Secondary: Mike (trained)
├─ Tertiary: Lisa (learning)
└─ Docs: Visual + recorded demos

Rotation Schedule:
Week 1-2: Sarah leads, Mike shadows
Week 3-4: Mike leads, Lisa shadows
Week 5-6: Lisa leads, Sarah advises

Result: No single point of failure
```

## Team Topologies in Practice

### The Four Fundamental Team Types

```
TEAM TOPOLOGIES FRAMEWORK (SKELTON & PAIS)
═════════════════════════════════════════

1. STREAM-ALIGNED TEAMS (The Workhorses)
   │
   ├─ Own: Full slice of business functionality
   ├─ Size: 5-9 people (cognitive limit)
   ├─ Focus: Fast flow of user value
   └─ Example: Checkout Team, Search Team

2. PLATFORM TEAMS (The Enablers)
   │
   ├─ Own: Internal services/tools
   ├─ Size: Similar, but can be larger
   ├─ Focus: Reduce cognitive load for others
   └─ Example: Deployment Platform, Data Platform

3. ENABLING TEAMS (The Teachers)
   │
   ├─ Own: Specialized knowledge
   ├─ Size: Small (3-5 experts)
   ├─ Focus: Growing capabilities in other teams
   └─ Example: SRE Practices, Security Champions

4. COMPLICATED SUBSYSTEM TEAMS (The Specialists)
   │
   ├─ Own: Complex technical domains
   ├─ Size: Varies with complexity
   ├─ Focus: Shield complexity from others
   └─ Example: ML Infrastructure, Video Encoding

│ ├─ Designer (1)                            │
│ └─ Product owner (1)                       │
│                                            │
│ Owns: Complete discovery experience        │
│ Deploys: Independently                     │
│ On-call: For their services only           │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Result: 3x faster feature delivery
        90% reduction in coordination overhead
        Cognitive load within human limits

### The 3 AM Equation

```
Effective_Capacity(t) = Base_Capacity × 
                       Sleep_Debt_Factor(t) × 
                       Stress_Factor(t) × 
                       Interruption_Factor(t)

Where:
- Sleep_Debt_Factor = 0.75^(hours_missed/8)
- Stress_Factor = e^(-stress_level/10)
- Interruption_Factor = 0.8^(context_switches)

Result at 3 AM after 3 pages:
Effective_Capacity = 7 × 0.75 × 0.37 × 0.51 ≈ 1-2 chunks

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Measure Your Team's Cognitive Load

Use the scoring framework to assess your team:
1. **Operational Clarity** (0-25 points)
2. **Stress Resilience** (0-25 points)  
3. **Team Sustainability** (0-25 points)
4. **Cognitive Design** (0-25 points)

Document specific examples for each score.

### Exercise 2: Alert Fatigue Analysis

Analyze your team's last week of alerts:
1. Total alerts received
2. Actionable vs non-actionable ratio
3. Time distribution (business hours vs after hours)
4. Alert response time patterns
5. False positive rate

Create an action plan to reduce alert fatigue by 50%.

### Exercise 3: Dashboard Redesign

Redesign your main ops dashboard following cognitive principles:
1. Maximum 7 key metrics visible
2. Progressive disclosure for details
3. Color coding that works under stress
4. Clear visual hierarchy
5. One-glance incident detection

Test the new design during a simulated incident.

## 🚀 Take Action Now

### Quick Wins This Week
1. **Count your alerts** - If > 100/day, you have a problem
2. **Ask your on-call** - "What's your stress level 1-10?" If > 7, act now
3. **Time an incident** - How long to find root cause? > 15 min = redesign needed
4. **Check turnover** - Lost anyone in ops/SRE lately? This is why.

### The Human-Centered Toolkit

```bash
# 1. Audit your alerts
./count_alerts.sh | grep -c "actionable" 
# If < 50%, start deleting

# 2. Measure dashboard complexity
find /dashboards -name "*.json" | wc -l
# If > 20, consolidate now

# 3. Check on-call health
echo "How many times were you paged last week?"
# If > 5, redesign rotations

# 4. Calculate team cognitive load
python3 cognitive_load_analyzer.py --team YOUR_TEAM
# If score > 25, stop feature work
```

!!! danger "🚨 TEAM BURNING OUT? Cognitive Load Emergency Kit:"
    1. **Measure Current Load** – Use the 7±2 assessment tool
    2. **Identify Overload Pattern** – Alert fatigue? Hero culture? Dashboard maze?
    3. **Apply Human-Centric Fix** – Simplify, automate, or eliminate
    4. **Monitor Team Health** – Track stress indicators weekly
    5. **Protect Recovery Time** – No incidents → no pages
    6. **Celebrate Sustainability** – Reward work-life balance

## The Bottom Line

!!! abstract "A Personal Note from the Real World"
    I've seen brilliant engineers reduced to tears at 3 AM, unable to remember their own system's architecture. I've watched marriages end over pager duty. I've attended too many "burnout farewell" parties. 
    
    This isn't about technology. It's about people. Your people. The ones who keep your systems running, who sacrifice sleep and sanity for uptime.
    
    They deserve better. This law shows you how to give it to them.

!!! success "Remember: Your Competitive Advantage"
    Companies that respect cognitive limits don't just retain talent—they attract it. In a world where everyone claims to care about "work-life balance," be the one that actually designs systems to support it. Your engineers will notice. Your competitors' engineers will notice too.
