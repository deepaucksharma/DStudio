# Graph Theory in Distributed Systems

> **Core Insight**: Distributed systems ARE graphs—nodes connected by edges. Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for analyzing and optimizing these systems.

## Fundamental Graph Models

### System as Graph G = (V, E)

```
V = {nodes/processes/servers}
E = {network links/communication channels}

Properties:
- |V| = n (number of nodes)
- |E| = m (number of edges)
- Diameter D = max shortest path
- Degree δ(v) = connections per node
```

### Graph Types in Distributed Systems

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Complete Graph Kn"
        K1[Node] --- K2[Node]
        K1 --- K3[Node]
        K1 --- K4[Node]
        K2 --- K3
        K2 --- K4
        K3 --- K4
    end
    
    subgraph "Ring Topology"
        R1[Node] --- R2[Node]
        R2 --- R3[Node]
        R3 --- R4[Node]
        R4 --- R1
    end
    
    subgraph "Tree/Hierarchical"
        T1[Root] --- T2[Node]
        T1 --- T3[Node]
        T2 --- T4[Leaf]
        T2 --- T5[Leaf]
        T3 --- T6[Leaf]
        T3 --- T7[Leaf]
    end
    
    subgraph "Mesh/Partial"
        M1[Node] --- M2[Node]
        M2 --- M3[Node]
        M3 --- M4[Node]
        M1 --- M3
        M2 --- M4
    end
```

## Spanning Trees for Broadcast

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

**Problem**: Broadcast message to all nodes with minimum cost

```python
def prim_mst_distributed():
    """
    Distributed Prim's algorithm for MST construction
    Time: O(n²) messages
    """
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, id):
            self.id = id
            self.in_mst = False
            self.parent = None
            self.min_weight_edge = float('inf')
        
        def find_min_edge(self, neighbors):
            # Each node finds minimum weight edge to MST
            for neighbor, weight in neighbors:
                if neighbor.in_mst and weight < self.min_weight_edge:
                    self.min_weight_edge = weight
                    self.parent = neighbor
        
        def join_mst(self):
            self.in_mst = True
            # Broadcast to neighbors
            broadcast("IN_MST", self.id)
```

**Applications**:
- Leader election
- Coordinated snapshots
- Configuration updates
- Multicast routing

### Breadth-First Spanning Tree

```python
def bfs_spanning_tree(root):
    """
    Construct BFS tree for shortest-path broadcast
    Messages: O(m) where m = edges
    Time: O(D) where D = diameter
    """
    level = {}
    parent = {}
    
    # Root starts
    level[root] = 0
    parent[root] = None
    
    # Wave algorithm
    for current_level in range(diameter):
        for node in nodes_at_level(current_level):
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in level:
                    level[neighbor] = current_level + 1
                    parent[neighbor] = node
                    send(neighbor, "PARENT", node)
    
    return parent  # Spanning tree
```

**Use Cases**:
- Dijkstra-Scholten termination detection
- Consistent global snapshots
- Barrier synchronization

## Graph Coloring for Resource Allocation

### Vertex Coloring Problem

**Goal**: Assign resources (colors) so no neighbors share same resource

```python
def distributed_graph_coloring(max_degree):
    """
    Distributed (Δ+1)-coloring where Δ = max degree
    Luby's algorithm - randomized, expected O(log n) rounds
    """
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, id):
            self.id = id
            self.color = None
            self.neighbors = []
        
        def select_color(self):
            while self.color is None:
                # Randomly propose color
                proposed = random.randint(1, max_degree + 1)
                
                # Check conflicts with neighbors
                conflicts = False
                for neighbor in self.neighbors:
                    if neighbor.color == proposed:
                        conflicts = True
                        break
                
                if not conflicts:
                    # Try to claim color
                    if self.try_claim(proposed):
                        self.color = proposed
```

**Applications**:
1. **Frequency Assignment**: Wireless networks
2. **Time Slot Allocation**: TDMA scheduling
3. **Register Allocation**: Distributed compilation
4. **Mutual Exclusion**: Process scheduling

### Edge Coloring for Scheduling

```python
def edge_coloring_schedule():
    """
    Schedule communications to avoid conflicts
    Vizing's theorem: Needs at most Δ+1 colors
    """
    # Each edge represents a communication
    # Colors represent time slots
    # No two edges sharing vertex can have same color
    
    for edge in edges:
        available_colors = set(range(1, max_degree + 2))
        for incident_edge in edge.incident_edges():
            if incident_edge.color:
                available_colors.discard(incident_edge.color)
        edge.color = min(available_colors)
```

## Minimum Cut for Partition Tolerance

### Finding Network Vulnerabilities

```python
def karger_min_cut():
    """
    Randomized min-cut algorithm
    Finds weakest points in network topology
    """
    graph = original_graph.copy()
    
    while graph.node_count() > 2:
        # Random edge contraction
        edge = random.choice(graph.edges())
        graph.contract_edge(edge)
    
    return graph.edges_between_remaining_nodes()

def analyze_partition_tolerance(graph):
    """
    Determine k-connectivity of network
    """
    min_cut_size = float('inf')
    
    # Run Karger's algorithm multiple times
    for _ in range(n * log(n)):
        cut_size = len(karger_min_cut())
        min_cut_size = min(min_cut_size, cut_size)
    
    return {
        'k_edge_connected': min_cut_size,
        'partition_tolerance': min_cut_size - 1,
        'redundancy_needed': max(0, target_k - min_cut_size)
    }
```

**Critical Insights**:
- k-connected → survives k-1 failures
- Min-cut identifies critical links
- Augmentation strategies for resilience

```python
def bron_kerbosch_cliques(graph):
    """
    Find all maximal cliques in network
    Cliques = fully connected subgroups
    Perfect for consensus/quorum groups
    """
    def bron_kerbosch(R, P, X):
        if not P and not X:
            yield R  # R is maximal clique
        
        for v in list(P):
            neighbors = graph.neighbors(v)
            bron_kerbosch(
                R | {v},
                P & neighbors,
                X & neighbors
            )
            P.remove(v)
            X.add(v)
    
    return bron_kerbosch(set(), set(graph.nodes), set())

def optimal_quorum_groups(graph, min_size=3):
    """
    Find optimal quorum groups as cliques
    """
    cliques = list(bron_kerbosch_cliques(graph))
    
    # Filter by minimum size for consensus
    quorum_groups = [c for c in cliques if len(c) >= min_size]
    
    # Overlap for Byzantine tolerance
    return assign_overlapping_quorums(quorum_groups)
```

**Applications**:
- Quorum selection in Paxos/Raft
- Byzantine fault-tolerant groups
- Cache coherence protocols
- Gossip dissemination groups

## Shortest Path Algorithms

```python
def distributed_bellman_ford(source):
    """

    Handles negative weights (latencies)
    Converges in O(n) rounds
    """
    distance = {node: float('inf') for node in nodes}
    distance[source] = 0
    
    for round in range(n - 1):
        for node in nodes:
            for neighbor, weight in node.edges:
                # Relaxation step
                new_dist = distance[node] + weight
                if new_dist < distance[neighbor]:
                    distance[neighbor] = new_dist
                    send(neighbor, "UPDATE", new_dist)
    
    # Detect negative cycles
    for node in nodes:
        for neighbor, weight in node.edges:
            if distance[node] + weight < distance[neighbor]:
                raise Exception("Negative cycle detected")
    
    return distance
```

**Use Cases**:

    """
    class Edge:
        def __init__(self, capacity):
            self.capacity = capacity
            self.flow = 0
            self.residual = capacity
    
    def find_augmenting_path():
        # Distributed BFS for path
        visited = set()
        queue = [source]

        while queue:

            if node == sink:
                return reconstruct_path(parent)
            
            for neighbor, edge in node.edges:
                if neighbor not in visited and edge.residual > 0:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    parent[neighbor] = (node, edge)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return None
    
    max_flow = 0
    while path := find_augmenting_path():
        # Find bottleneck capacity
        bottleneck = min(edge.residual for _, edge in path)
        
        # Update flows
        for node, edge in path:
            edge.flow += bottleneck
            edge.residual -= bottleneck
            # Update reverse edge
