## Hard Questions (90 minutes)

### Question 1: CAP Theorem Trade-offs (15 minutes)

You're designing a global financial trading platform with the following requirements:
- Trade executions must be consistent across all regions
- System must remain available during network partitions
- Users in Asia, Europe, and Americas need <100ms response times
- No trade can be executed twice or lost

**Part A (5 points):** Analyze the CAP theorem implications for this system. Which two properties would you choose and why?

**Part B (5 points):** Design a concrete architecture showing how you handle the third property you sacrificed. Include specific technologies and protocols.

**Part C (5 points):** Calculate the theoretical minimum latency for a trade that requires confirmation from replicas in all three regions, given:
- Network latency: Asia-Europe 180ms, Europe-Americas 120ms, Americas-Asia 200ms
- Local processing: 5ms per operation

### Question 2: Multi-Master Replication Conflicts (15 minutes)

Design a conflict resolution strategy for a collaborative shopping cart system where users can modify their cart from multiple devices simultaneously.

**Scenario:** User adds item A from phone, removes item B from laptop, and modifies quantity of item C from tablet - all within 100ms.

**Part A (7 points):** Design the data structure and conflict resolution algorithm. Show the state transitions and final result.

**Part B (4 points):** Implement the merge logic in pseudocode that ensures no items are lost and user intent is preserved.

**Part C (4 points):** Analyze edge cases: What happens if the same item is added and removed simultaneously? How do you handle quantity conflicts?

---

### Question 3: Quorum Systems and Availability (15 minutes)

You have a 7-node distributed database cluster serving an e-commerce platform.

**Part A (5 points):** Calculate the optimal read (R) and write (W) quorum values for:
- Strong consistency requirement
- Maximum write availability
- Balance between read and write performance

Show your formulas and reasoning.

**Part B (5 points):** During a network partition, nodes split as [3, 2, 2]. Analyze which operations can continue for each of your quorum configurations above.

**Part C (5 points):** Design a dynamic quorum adjustment strategy for when nodes fail. How would you modify R and W values as the cluster size changes from 7‚Üí5‚Üí3 nodes?

---

### Question 4: Consistency Models in Practice (15 minutes)

A social media platform needs to handle different types of data with varying consistency requirements:

1. User posts and comments
2. Friend relationships
3. Like counts and engagement metrics  
4. User account balance for premium features
5. Real-time messaging

**Part A (8 points):** For each data type, choose the appropriate consistency model (strong, causal, session, eventual) and justify your choice based on business requirements and user experience impact.

**Part B (7 points):** Design the system architecture showing how these different consistency models coexist. How do you prevent consistency model conflicts when data types interact (e.g., posting a message that affects like counts)?

---

### Question 5: Replication Lag and Performance (15 minutes)

Your primary-replica database has the following characteristics:
- Write throughput: 10,000 ops/sec
- Network bandwidth to replicas: 100 Mbps
- Average record size: 2KB
- 5 read replicas across 3 data centers

**Part A (5 points):** Calculate the theoretical minimum replication lag. What factors could increase this in practice?

**Part B (5 points):** Design a replication strategy to minimize read lag while maintaining write performance. Consider batching, compression, and selective replication.

**Part C (5 points):** The business requires that critical reads (user balance checks) are never stale, while non-critical reads (profile views) can tolerate 10-second staleness. How do you modify your architecture?

---

### Question 6: Split-Brain Prevention and Recovery (15 minutes)

Design a comprehensive split-brain prevention and recovery system for a distributed key-value store.

**Part A (6 points):** Implement a split-brain detection algorithm using heartbeats and quorum checks. Include the decision logic for when a node should stop accepting writes.

**Part B (5 points):** During recovery from a split-brain scenario, you discover conflicting writes to the same keys in both partitions. Design a recovery strategy that minimizes data loss.

**Part C (4 points):** How would you test your split-brain prevention system? Describe specific test scenarios and expected behaviors.

## Very Hard Questions (90 minutes)

### Question 7: CRDT Design and Implementation (22 minutes)

Design a CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) for a collaborative rich text editor supporting:
- Text insertion and deletion at any position
- Character formatting (bold, italic, color)
- Real-time collaboration with 100+ simultaneous editors

**Part A (10 points):** Design the core data structure. How do you handle:
- Position-based operations when the document changes
- Concurrent insertions at the same position
- Deletion of already-deleted text
- Undo/redo operations

**Part B (7 points):** Implement the merge algorithm in pseudocode. Show how two document replicas with concurrent edits converge to the same state.

**Part C (5 points):** Analyze the space and time complexity of your solution. How do you prevent unbounded growth of tombstones and operation metadata?

---

### Question 8: Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus (22 minutes)

Implement a simplified Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm for a distributed ledger system.

**Part A (8 points):** Design the three-phase consensus protocol (pre-prepare, prepare, commit). Show the message flows and validation logic for each phase.

**Part B (8 points):** Calculate the minimum number of nodes needed to tolerate f Byzantine failures. If you have 10 nodes and suspect 3 might be malicious, can you achieve consensus? Show your work.

**Part C (6 points):** Handle the view-change protocol. What happens when the primary node is suspected to be Byzantine? Design the leader election and state transfer process.

---

### Question 9: Production State Distribution Architecture (23 minutes)

You're the architect for a global distributed system serving 500M users across 6 continents with these requirements:

- User data (profiles, preferences): 50GB per region
- Transaction logs: 1TB/day globally  
- Real-time analytics: 100K events/sec
- Financial transactions: ACID compliance required
- Chat messages: Real-time delivery, eventual consistency OK
- System must survive entire data center failures

**Part A (10 points):** Design the overall architecture including:
- Data partitioning and placement strategy
- Replication topology and consistency models
- Cross-region coordination mechanisms

**Part B (7 points):** Calculate storage and bandwidth requirements:
- Total storage needed with appropriate replication factors
- Cross-region bandwidth for synchronization
- Disaster recovery storage requirements

**Part C (6 points):** Design the monitoring and alerting system. What metrics would indicate problems with state distribution? Include specific thresholds and escalation procedures.

### Question 10: Advanced Conflict Resolution Scenario (23 minutes)

A distributed e-commerce inventory system faces this complex scenario:

- Product X has 5 units in stock
- Warehouse A: Customer 1 orders 3 units at 14:30:00.100
- Warehouse B: Customer 2 orders 4 units at 14:30:00.150  
- Warehouse C: Inventory team adds 10 units at 14:30:00.125
- Network partition prevents immediate synchronization
- Each warehouse processes its operation locally

**Part A (10 points):** Model this scenario using:
1. Last-Writer-Wins with vector clocks
2. CRDT PN-Counter approach
3. Multi-version concurrency control

Show the state evolution and final result for each approach.

**Part B (8 points):** The business rules are:
- Never oversell inventory
- Prefer customer orders over inventory adjustments
- Minimize customer disappointment (partial fulfillment OK)

Design a conflict resolution algorithm that respects these priorities. Handle the case where resolution requires customer notification.

**Part C (5 points):** Extend your solution to handle priority customers (VIP status) and product reservations (items held for 15 minutes). How does this change the conflict resolution logic?
