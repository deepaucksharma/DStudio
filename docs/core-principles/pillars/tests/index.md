- Rapid knowledge check
- Multiple choice, true/false, calculations
- 75% passing score

### 📚 **Learning Module** (45 minutes)
- 60 comprehensive questions
- Progressive difficulty
- Detailed explanations
- Real-world scenarios

### 🎓 **Mastery Exam** (60 minutes)
- 40 expert-level questions
- Tests synthesis and application
- Complex scenarios
- 80% passing score

## Study Recommendations

### For Beginners
1. Start with Quick Assessments to identify knowledge gaps
2. Review pillar documentation for weak areas
3. Complete Learning Modules with open documentation
4. Attempt Quick Assessments again

### For Intermediate Learners
1. Complete all Quick Assessments
2. Work through Learning Modules
3. Practice with real-world scenarios
4. Take Mastery Exams when ready

### For Advanced Practitioners
1. Go directly to Mastery Exams
2. Aim for 90%+ scores
3. Focus on cross-pillar integration
4. Apply concepts to production systems

---

## Assessment Strategy

### Time Management
- **Quick Assessment:** 1 minute per question
- **Learning Module:** 45 seconds per question
- **Mastery Exam:** 1.5 minutes per question

### Scoring Guidelines
| Score | Level | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 90-100% | Expert | Ready for architecture decisions |
| 80-89% | Advanced | Can implement solutions |
| 70-79% | Proficient | Understands concepts |
| 60-69% | Developing | Need more practice |
| <60% | Beginner | Review fundamentals |

### Tips for Success
1. **Read carefully** - Questions test precise understanding
2. **Calculate quickly** - Have formulas ready
3. **Think patterns** - Recognize common scenarios
4. **Consider trade-offs** - No perfect solutions
5. **Learn from mistakes** - Review incorrect answers

## Integration with Laws

The 5 Pillars work together with the [7 Laws](../../laws/tests/index.md):

- **Laws** define what you *cannot* do (constraints)
- **Pillars** guide what you *should* do (patterns)

### Cross-References
- Work Distribution ↔ Law 3 (Emergent Chaos)
- State Distribution ↔ Law 4 (Multidimensional Optimization)  
- Truth Distribution ↔ Law 5 (Distributed Knowledge)
- Control Distribution ↔ Law 6 (Cognitive Load)
- Intelligence Distribution ↔ Law 7 (Economic Reality)
