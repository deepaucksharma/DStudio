‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 25 minutes | üìù **25 questions** | ‚úÖ **Passing:** 75%

!!! abstract "Core Principle"
    Coordinating actions, managing decisions, and handling control flow across distributed components while maintaining system coherence.

---

## Section A: Fundamentals (10 questions)

- C) Data loss
- D) Performance issues

### 7. [Calculate] Token Ring Nodes
In a token ring with 10 nodes, maximum hops for token?
- **Answer:** 9 hops

### 8. [True/False] Coordination-free
Coordination-free algorithms always have lower latency.
- **Answer:** True
- **Reason:** No synchronization overhead.

### 9. [One-line] Saga Pattern
What problem does the Saga pattern solve?
- **Answer:** Distributed transactions without 2PC

### 10. [Fill in Blank] Circuit breakers prevent _______ failures.
- **Answer:** cascading

## Section B: Implementation (10 questions)

### 11. [Multiple Choice] Service Mesh Control
Service mesh primarily provides:
- A) Data storage
- B) Traffic management and observability ‚úì
- C) Database connections
- D) User authentication only

### 12. [Pattern Match] Failure Handling
Match strategy to scenario:
1. Retry            A. Permanent failure
2. Circuit breaker  B. Transient failure
3. Fallback        C. Repeated failures
4. Hedging         D. Slow response

**Answers:** 1-B, 2-C, 3-A, 4-D

### 13. [True/False] Timeouts
Infinite timeouts eliminate timeout-related failures.
- **Answer:** False
- **Reason:** Can cause indefinite blocking and resource exhaustion.

### 14. [Multiple Choice] Bulkhead Pattern
The bulkhead pattern isolates:
- A) Network traffic
- B) Failure domains ‚úì
- C) User sessions
- D) Database queries

### 15. [One-line] Backpressure
What does backpressure signal in distributed systems?
- **Answer:** Consumer overwhelmed, slow down producer

### 16. [Fill in Blank] _______ routing sends requests to multiple backends simultaneously.
- **Answer:** Hedged (or speculative)

### 17. [Calculate] Timeout Budget
If total timeout is 10s across 3 sequential services, per-service timeout?
- **Answer:** ~3.3 seconds

## Quick Reference Card

### Control Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Trade-off |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Orchestration** | Complex workflows | Central bottleneck |
| **Choreography** | Loose coupling | Complex debugging |
| **Saga** | Distributed transactions | Compensation logic |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Failure isolation | Availability vs accuracy |

### Coordination Strategies

1. **Leader-based:** Single coordinator
2. **Token-based:** Rotating control
3. **Gossip-based:** Epidemic spread
4. **Consensus-based:** Group agreement
5. **Lock-free:** Optimistic control

### Resilience Patterns

- **Timeout:** Bound waiting time
- **Retry:** Handle transients
- **Circuit Breaker:** Fail fast
- **Bulkhead:** Isolate failures
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent overload

### Remember
- **Avoid synchronous chains** - They compound failure
- **Fail fast** - Don't wait indefinitely
- **Isolate failures** - Prevent cascades
- **Local decisions scale** - Global coordination doesn't
