# Core Principles

Master the fundamental laws and pillars that govern all distributed systems.

## Why Physics Matters for Software

Understanding distributed systems requires grasping the fundamental constraints imposed by physics - the speed of light, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. These aren't abstract concepts but real limits that manifest as network latency, heat dissipation, and information propagation delays in every distributed architecture.

!!! info "Physics-Derived Foundation"
    Every pattern in this compendium traces back to physical constraints. By starting with fundamental laws, you'll develop intuition for why certain architectures work and others fail at scale.

## Overview

Distributed systems are governed by **7 immutable laws** derived from physics and organized around **5 core pillars** that shape every architectural decision. This section provides the theoretical foundation you'll need before diving into specific patterns.
