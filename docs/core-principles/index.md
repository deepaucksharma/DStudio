# Core Principles

Master the fundamental laws and pillars that govern all distributed systems.

## Overview

Distributed systems are governed by immutable laws derived from physics and organized around core pillars that shape every architectural decision. This section provides the theoretical foundation you'll need before diving into specific patterns.
