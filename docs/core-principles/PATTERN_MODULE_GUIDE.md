### Day 3-4: Content Creation

```markdown
# Example Focus Block: Circuit Breaker Mechanics

## 🎯 PRIMING: "Your payment service just died. How long until your entire platform collapses?"

Without a circuit breaker: 2-3 minutes.
With a circuit breaker: Your platform stays up, degrades gracefully.

## 📚 CORE CONCEPT: The Three States of Protection

A circuit breaker exists in one of three states, automatically transitioning based on failure patterns:

### State 1: CLOSED (Normal Operation)
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Closed: Success
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    
    note right of Closed
        All requests pass through
        Monitor failure rate
        Count consecutive failures
    end note
```

**In this state:**
- Requests flow normally to the service
- Every response is monitored
- Failures are counted against threshold
- Success resets failure count

### State 2: OPEN (Failure Protection)
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Open --> HalfOpen: After timeout period
    Open --> Open: Requests rejected immediately
    
    note right of Open
        Fast fail all requests
        No load on failing service
        Wait for recovery timeout
    end note
```

**In this state:**
- All requests fail immediately
- No pressure on failing service
- Returns cached/default responses
- Waits for timeout before testing

### State 3: HALF-OPEN (Recovery Test)
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Test succeeds
    HalfOpen --> Open: Test fails
    
    note right of HalfOpen
        Allow limited test traffic
        Monitor test results
        Decide on full recovery
    end note
```

## 🧠 NEURAL BRIDGE: The Home Electrical System

Your home's electrical circuit breaker works exactly like this pattern:
- **Normal (CLOSED)**: Power flows freely
- **Overload detected**: Breaker trips (OPEN)
- **Manual reset**: Test if problem fixed (HALF-OPEN)
- **Safe again**: Normal operation resumes (CLOSED)

The software version just does this automatically!

## 🏃 ACTIVE PRACTICE: Configure Your Breaker

Given these service characteristics:
- Normal failure rate: 0.1%
- Acceptable failure rate: 5%
- Recovery time: Usually 30-60 seconds
- Traffic: 1000 requests/minute

Calculate:
1. Optimal failure threshold: _______
2. Recovery timeout: _______
3. Success threshold for recovery: _______

**Solution:**
1. Failure threshold: 50 failures (5% of 1000)
2. Recovery timeout: 45 seconds (middle of recovery range)
3. Success threshold: 10 consecutive successes

## 💭 CONSOLIDATION PROMPT

**Reflect on these questions:**
1. What happens if your failure threshold is too low? Too high?
2. How would you handle different types of failures differently?
3. When would a circuit breaker make things worse?
4. How does this pattern interact with retries?
```

### Day 5: Exam Creation

```markdown
# Circuit Breaker Pattern - Mastery Assessment

## Question 1: State Transition Analysis

### Scenario
Your circuit breaker is CLOSED with these settings:
- Failure threshold: 5
- Recovery timeout: 30 seconds
- Success threshold: 3

The following sequence occurs:
1. 4 failures in a row
2. 1 success
3. 5 failures in a row
4. Wait 31 seconds
5. 2 successes
6. 1 failure

**Question:** What state is the circuit breaker in after each step?

### Comprehensive Model Answer

**Step-by-step state analysis:**

**Initial State: CLOSED**
- Failure count: 0
- Ready to accept requests

**After Step 1 (4 failures):**
- State: Still CLOSED
- Failure count: 4
- Analysis: Below threshold of 5, staying closed
- Risk: One more failure triggers opening

**After Step 2 (1 success):**
- State: CLOSED
- Failure count: 0 (reset on success)
- Analysis: Success in CLOSED state resets counter
- System appears healthy

**After Step 3 (5 failures):**
- State: Transitions to OPEN
- Failure count: 5 reached threshold
- Timestamp: Marked for recovery timeout
- Impact: All requests now fast-fail

**After Step 4 (Wait 31 seconds):**
- State: Ready to transition to HALF-OPEN on next request
- Analysis: Recovery timeout expired
- Next request will test service health

**After Step 5 (2 successes):**
- State: HALF-OPEN
- Success count: 2
- Analysis: Below success threshold of 3
- Still testing service recovery

**After Step 6 (1 failure):**
- State: Transitions back to OPEN
- Success count: Reset to 0
- Analysis: Any failure in HALF-OPEN returns to OPEN
- Must wait another 30 seconds

**Key Insights:**
1. Success in CLOSED resets failure counter completely
2. HALF-OPEN is unforgiving - single failure reopens
3. Recovery requires sustained success, not just availability
4. The pattern prevents premature recovery attempts

**Production Implications:**
- Consider gradual recovery (10%, 50%, 100% traffic)
- Log state transitions for analysis
- Alert on repeated HALF-OPEN failures
- Monitor time spent in each state
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides everything needed to create professional-quality learning modules for distributed system patterns. Each module should take 3-5 days to develop, with another 1-2 days for review and refinement.

Remember: The goal is not just to explain patterns, but to enable engineers to recognize when to use them, implement them correctly, and debug them when they fail.

Start with one pattern, perfect the process, then scale to the rest.
