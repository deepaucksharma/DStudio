# Company-Specific Interview Guides

## Overview

Each major technology company has developed distinct engineering cultures, architectural preferences, and interview styles that reflect their business priorities and technical challenges. These company-specific guides provide targeted preparation strategies, focusing on the unique aspects that set each organization apart from generic interview preparation.

## Why Company-Specific Preparation Matters

### Cultural Alignment
Each company prioritizes different values - Apple's privacy-first design, Amazon's customer obsession, Google's data-driven decisions, and Meta's move-fast culture. Understanding these cultural nuances helps you frame technical discussions appropriately and demonstrate alignment with their engineering philosophy.

### Technical Focus Areas
Companies emphasize different technical domains based on their core products:
- **Apple**: Privacy-preserving systems, local-first processing, cross-platform integration
- **Amazon**: Massive scale distributed systems, cost optimization, operational excellence  
- **Google**: Search and information retrieval, machine learning infrastructure, web-scale systems
- **Meta**: Social networking algorithms, real-time communication, content delivery
- **Microsoft**: Enterprise software, hybrid cloud solutions, productivity platforms
- **Netflix**: Video streaming infrastructure, chaos engineering, personalization systems

### Interview Style Differences
- Some companies emphasize system design depth (Meta, Google)
- Others focus on operational excellence (Amazon, Netflix)
- Many prioritize cross-functional collaboration (Apple, Microsoft)
- All have unique behavioral question patterns reflecting their values

4. **Practice Company-Specific Questions**: Each guide includes typical questions for that company
5. **Understand Their Values**: Align your answers with their cultural principles

### Common Patterns Across Companies

#### System Design Focus Areas
- **Scalability**: All companies deal with massive user bases
- **Reliability**: Uptime and consistency expectations vary by business model
- **Performance**: Latency requirements differ based on use cases
- **Cost**: Infrastructure efficiency priorities vary significantly

#### Leadership Expectations
