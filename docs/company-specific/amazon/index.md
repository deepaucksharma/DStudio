## Amazon's Leadership Principles

### Core Principles (Key for Interviews)
- **Customer Obsession**: Start with customer and work backwards
- **Ownership**: Think long term and don't sacrifice for short-term results
- **Invent and Simplify**: Expect innovation and invention from everyone
- **Are Right, A Lot**: Strong judgment and good instincts
- **Learn and Be Curious**: Never stop learning and improving
- **Hire and Develop the Best**: Raise the performance bar with every hire
- **Insist on the Highest Standards**: Continually raise the bar
- **Think Big**: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy
- **Bias for Action**: Speed matters, many decisions are reversible
- **Frugality**: Accomplish more with less
- **Earn Trust**: Listen attentively, speak candidly, treat others respectfully
- **Dive Deep**: Operate at all levels and stay connected to details
- **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**: Respectfully challenge, commit fully
- **Deliver Results**: Focus on key inputs and deliver quality outcomes
- **Strive to be Earth's Best Employer**: Work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment
- **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility**: Impact on the world requires humility

## Interview Process Overview

### Interview Loop Structure
1. **Phone Screen** (45-60 minutes)
   - Coding or system design
   - 2-3 leadership principles
   - Bar raiser assessment

2. **On-site Loop** (4-6 interviews)
   - **System Design** (45-60 min): Large scale architecture
   - **Coding Rounds** (2x 45 min): Data structures and algorithms
   - **Behavioral/LP** (2-3 rounds): Leadership principles deep-dive
   - **Bar Raiser**: Independent assessment for maintaining hiring standards

3. **Debrief**: All interviewers discuss and reach consensus

### Key Success Factors
- **STAR Method**: Situation, Task, Action, Result for behavioral questions
- **Specificity**: Provide concrete examples with metrics
- **Leadership Impact**: Show how you influenced others and drove results
- **Customer Focus**: Always tie back to customer impact
- **Scale Thinking**: Demonstrate experience with large-scale problems

## Technical Focus Areas

### System Design Priorities
- **Scale**: Handle millions/billions of requests
- **Reliability**: 99.99%+ uptime requirements
- **Cost Optimization**: Frugality at every layer
- **Security**: Defense in depth, zero trust
- **Performance**: Low latency, high throughput

### AWS Integration
```python
# Amazon's cloud-native thinking
class AWSNativeService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
        self.s3 = boto3.client('s3')
        self.sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
        
    def design_for_scale(self):
        # Auto-scaling, managed services preferred
        return {
            'compute': 'Lambda + ECS Fargate',
            'storage': 'DynamoDB + S3',
            'messaging': 'SQS + SNS',
            'monitoring': 'CloudWatch + X-Ray'
        }
```

## Common Interview Topics

### System Design Questions
- Design Amazon's recommendation system
- Build a distributed cache like ElastiCache
- Design Amazon Prime Video's streaming architecture
- Create a global inventory management system
- Build Amazon's order processing pipeline

### Leadership Principle Questions
- **Customer Obsession**: "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer"
- **Ownership**: "Describe a project you drove end-to-end without being asked"
- **Invent and Simplify**: "Give an example of when you simplified a complex process"
- **Think Big**: "Tell me about a time you proposed a bold new direction"
- **Dive Deep**: "Describe a time you had to understand a problem at a granular level"

## Preparation Strategy

### Leadership Principles Practice
```markdown
For each of the 16 principles, prepare 2-3 STAR stories:
- Recent examples (within 2 years)
- Quantified impact with metrics
- Show progression in responsibility
- Demonstrate customer impact
- Include failure/learning stories
```

### Technical Preparation
1. **AWS Services**: Understand core AWS offerings and when to use them
2. **Distributed Systems**: CAP theorem, consistency models, fault tolerance
3. **Scale Patterns**: Sharding, caching, load balancing, CDNs
4. **Data Processing**: Batch vs stream processing, MapReduce concepts
5. **Security**: IAM, encryption, network security

### Mock Interview Focus
- Practice system design with AWS services
- Time-box responses (3-4 minutes per LP question)
- Include customer impact in every technical decision
- Show cost consciousness in design choices
- Demonstrate bias for action with examples
