## Interview Process

### Interview Structure
1. **Recruiter Screen** (30 minutes)
   - Background and motivation
   - Role expectations alignment
   - Compensation discussion

2. **Technical Phone Screen** (45 minutes)
   - Coding interview or system design
   - Problem-solving approach
   - Communication and clarification skills

3. **On-site/Virtual Loop** (4-5 rounds)
   - **Coding** (2 rounds Ã— 45 min): Algorithms and data structures
   - **System Design** (45 min): Large-scale distributed systems
   - **Behavioral** (45 min): Meta values and cultural fit
   - **Product Sense** (45 min): Understanding user needs and product thinking

### Key Assessment Areas
- **Technical Excellence**: Clean code, optimal solutions
- **System Thinking**: Scale, reliability, performance
- **Product Intuition**: User empathy and product sense
- **Cultural Alignment**: Meta values demonstration
- **Communication**: Clear explanation of complex topics

## Technical Focus Areas

### Meta's Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python, C++, JavaScript, Hack/PHP
- **Mobile**: React Native, Swift, Kotlin
- **Web**: React, GraphQL, Relay
- **Backend**: MySQL, Cassandra, Memcached, Thrift
- **Infrastructure**: Custom data centers, edge computing

### Scale Characteristics
```python
# Meta's billion-user scale thinking
class MetaScaleService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_base = 3_800_000_000  # 3.8B monthly active users
        self.qps = 1_000_000  # 1M+ queries per second
        self.data_centers = 21  # Global presence
    
    def design_for_scale(self):
        return {
            'caching': 'Multi-tier with Memcached clusters',
            'database': 'Sharded MySQL with read replicas',
            'cdn': 'Global edge network for media',
            'messaging': 'Custom pub-sub at massive scale'
        }
```

## Common Interview Topics

### System Design Questions
- Design Facebook's news feed ranking algorithm
- Build Instagram's photo storage and serving system
- Design WhatsApp's message delivery system
- Create a real-time chat system for billions of users
- Build a global content delivery network for video

### Behavioral Questions (Meta Values)
- "Tell me about a time you moved fast and broke something"
- "Describe when you took a bold risk that paid off"
- "How do you measure and maximize impact in your work?"
- "Give an example of when you were transparent about a mistake"
- "How do you balance user needs with business objectives?"

### Product Sense Questions
- "How would you improve Facebook Groups?"
- "Design a feature to help people make new friends"
- "How would you measure the success of Instagram Stories?"
- "What would you build to increase user engagement?"

## Preparation Strategy

### Technical Focus Areas
1. **Large Scale Systems**: CAP theorem, consistency models, partitioning
2. **Real-time Systems**: WebSockets, push notifications, live streaming
3. **Social Graph**: Friend recommendations, network effects, viral mechanics
4. **Machine Learning**: Recommendation systems, ranking algorithms, A/B testing
5. **Mobile Performance**: Battery optimization, offline sync, network efficiency

### Practice Scenarios
```markdown
Week 1-2: Fundamentals
- Practice coding with C++, Python focus
- Review distributed systems concepts
