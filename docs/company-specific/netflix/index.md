## Netflix Culture

### Core Values
- **Freedom and Responsibility**: High performance with minimal rules
- **Context, not Control**: Provide context for independent decision-making
- **Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled**: Clear strategy, autonomous execution
- **Pay Top of Market**: Retain and attract the best talent
- **Keeper Test**: Would you fight to keep this person?

### Engineering Philosophy
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled, highly autonomous services
- **Cloud Native**: AWS-first architecture
- **Chaos Engineering**: Embrace failure to build resilience
- **Data-Driven**: A/B test everything, measure everything
- **Global Scale**: 230+ million subscribers worldwide

## Interview Process

### Interview Structure
1. **Recruiter Screen** (30 minutes)
   - Cultural fit assessment
   - Role alignment discussion
   - Compensation framework

2. **Hiring Manager Screen** (45 minutes)
   - Technical background deep-dive
   - Past project discussions
   - Netflix culture alignment

3. **Technical Interview Loop** (3-4 rounds)
   - **System Design** (60 min): Streaming architecture at scale
   - **Coding** (45 min): Problem-solving and code quality
   - **Technical Deep-Dive** (45 min): Domain expertise
   - **Cultural Interview** (45 min): Netflix values alignment

### Unique Aspects
- **No Leetcode Focus**: Practical problem-solving over algorithms
- **Real-World Problems**: Design systems you'd actually build
- **Culture Emphasis**: Strong focus on culture-performance fit
- **Senior-Level Expectations**: High bar for independence and impact

## Technical Focus Areas

### Netflix Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices**: 1000+ microservices in production
- **Event-Driven**: Async communication between services
- **Circuit Breakers**: Hystrix for fault tolerance
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka for dynamic service registry
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack

### Streaming Technology Stack
```java
// Netflix's microservices approach
@RestController
public class RecommendationService {
    
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultRecommendations")
    public List<Movie> getRecommendations(String userId) {
        // Call multiple services with circuit breakers
        UserProfile profile = userService.getProfile(userId);
        ViewingHistory history = historyService.getHistory(userId);
        
        return mlService.generateRecommendations(profile, history);
    }
    
    public List<Movie> defaultRecommendations(String userId) {
        // Fallback to popular content
        return popularContentService.getTrending();
    }
}
```

## Common Interview Topics

### System Design Questions
- Design Netflix's video streaming architecture
- Build a recommendation system for 200M+ users
- Design Netflix's content delivery network (CDN)
- Create a real-time analytics system for viewing data
- Build Netflix's A/B testing platform

### Netflix Culture Questions
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager's direction"
- "How do you handle ambiguous requirements with minimal oversight?"
- "Describe when you had to make a difficult decision with incomplete information"
- "Give an example of when you took ownership beyond your role"
- "How do you balance speed of delivery with code quality?"

### Technical Challenges
- Video encoding and transcoding at scale
- Global content distribution and caching
- Personalization and machine learning
- Microservices orchestration and monitoring
- Chaos engineering and resilience testing

## Preparation Strategy

### Technical Deep-Dive Areas
1. **Distributed Systems**: Microservices, event sourcing, CQRS
2. **Streaming Technology**: Video codecs, CDNs, adaptive bitrate
3. **Machine Learning**: Recommendation systems, collaborative filtering
4. **Cloud Architecture**: AWS services, auto-scaling, cost optimization
5. **Monitoring/Observability**: Metrics, logging, distributed tracing

### Culture Preparation
```markdown
Netflix Values Practice:
- Prepare examples of working with minimal oversight
- Show instances of challenging status quo respectfully
- Demonstrate data-driven decision making
- Examples of taking calculated risks
- Times you've mentored or developed others
```

### Recommended Study Materials
- Netflix Technology Blog posts
- Chaos Monkey and chaos engineering papers
- Microservices architecture patterns
- Video streaming technology fundamentals
- A/B testing and experimentation frameworks

### Interview Tips
- **Think Like an Owner**: Consider business impact, not just technical elegance
- **Embrace Failure**: Discuss failures and learnings openly
- **Global Scale**: Always consider Netflix's 230M+ subscriber base
