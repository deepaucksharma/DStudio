## Usage Guidelines

1. **Focus on Real-World Application**: Every exercise should mirror actual engineering challenges
2. **Provide Clear Constraints**: Specific numbers and requirements, not vague descriptions
3. **Scaffold Complexity**: Build from simple to complex within each section
4. **Include Team Exercises**: Distributed systems require collaboration
5. **Emphasize Documentation**: Clear communication is as important as implementation
6. **Connect to Production**: Use real company examples and published architectures
7. **Support Multiple Solutions**: Acknowledge trade-offs rather than one "right" answer
