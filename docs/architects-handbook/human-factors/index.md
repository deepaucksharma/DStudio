# Human Factors

Operational excellence, team practices, and organizational patterns for distributed systems.

## Overview

Building successful distributed systems isn't just about technology‚Äîit's about people. This section covers the human aspects of operating distributed systems at scale, including team organization, operational practices, and cultural patterns.

## üìö Core Topics

### Site Reliability Engineering
- **[SRE Principles](sre-practices.mdindex.md)** - Error budgets, SLIs/SLOs/SLAs
- **[Toil Reduction](knowledge-management.mdindex.md)** - Automating operational work
- **[Capacity Management](../tools/capacity-calculator.mdindex.md)** - Planning for growth
- **[Release Engineering](incident-response.mdindex.md)** - Safe deployment practices

### Incident Management
- **[Incident Response](incident-response.md)** - Handling production issues
- **[Postmortem Culture](blameless-postmortems.mdindex.md)** - Learning from failures
- **[Runbook Development](runbooks-playbooks.mdindex.md)** - Standardized procedures
- **[War Room Protocols](incident-response.mdindex.md)** - Crisis coordination

### On-Call Practices
- **[On-Call Philosophy](oncall-culture.mdindex.md)** - Sustainable practices
- **[Escalation Policies](incident-response.mdindex.md)** - Clear responsibility chains
- **[Alert Fatigue](observability-stacks.mdindex.md)** - Reducing noise
- **[Handoff Procedures](oncall-culture.mdindex.md)** - Smooth transitions

### Observability & Monitoring
- **[Observability Strategy](observability-stacks.mdindex.md)** - Metrics, logs, traces
- **[Dashboard Design](observability-stacks.mdindex.md)** - Effective visualizations
- **[Alert Design](observability-stacks.mdindex.md)** - Actionable notifications
- **[Debugging Distributed Systems](incident-response.mdindex.md)** - Systematic approaches

## üè¢ Organizational Patterns

### Team Structures
- **[Platform Teams](platform-teams/index.md)** - Internal infrastructure
- **[Service Teams](service-teams/index.md)** - Feature delivery
- **[SRE Teams](sre-teams/index.md)** - Reliability focus
- **[DevOps Culture](devops-culture/index.md)** - Breaking down silos

### Communication Patterns
- **[Technical Documentation](technical-documentation/index.md)** - Knowledge sharing
- **[Design Reviews](design-reviews/index.md)** - Collaborative architecture
- **[Operational Reviews](operational-reviews/index.md)** - Continuous improvement
- **[Blameless Culture](blameless-culture/index.md)** - Psychological safety

### Skills Development
- **[Learning Paths](../architects-handbook/learning-paths/index.md)** - Career progression
- **[Mentorship Programs](mentorship/index.md)** - Knowledge transfer
- **[Chaos Engineering](chaos-engineering.md)** - Building confidence
- **[Game Days](game-days/index.md)** - Practice scenarios

## üìä Metrics & KPIs

### Operational Metrics
| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| MTTR | <30 min | Recovery speed |
| Deploy Frequency | Daily | Agility |
| Change Failure Rate | <5% | Quality |
| Toil Percentage | <30% | Automation |

### Team Health Metrics
- **Burnout Indicators** - On-call load, ticket volume
- **Knowledge Distribution** - Bus factor, documentation coverage
- **Innovation Time** - % time on improvements
- **Team Satisfaction** - Regular surveys

## üéØ Best Practices

### Building Resilient Teams
1. **Rotate Responsibilities** - Avoid single points of failure
2. **Document Everything** - Reduce tribal knowledge
3. **Practice Failures** - Build muscle memory
4. **Celebrate Learning** - Not just successes

### Operational Excellence
1. **Automate Toil** - Focus on high-value work
2. **Measure Everything** - Data-driven decisions
3. **Gradual Rollouts** - Reduce blast radius
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular retrospectives

## üìö Case Studies

### Netflix: Chaos Engineering Culture
- Regular failure injection
- Full-system resilience tests
- Shared responsibility model

### Google: SRE Model
- Error budgets drive priorities
- 50% cap on operational work
- Embedded SRE teams

### Amazon: Operational Excellence
- Weekly operational reviews
- Everything fails mentality
- Two-pizza teams
