# Blameless Postmortems

**Learning from failures without finger-pointing (Law 6: Human-API 🤯)**

> *"We seek to understand not who failed, but how the system allowed failure to occur - recognizing that human error often stems from cognitive overload."*

---

## What is a Blameless Postmortem?

Structured incident review focusing on systemic issues, not individual blame. Goal: learn and improve.

## Key Principles (Aligned with Law 6: Human-API)

### 1. Systems Thinking
- Focus on how system allowed error
- Look for contributing factors beyond individual capacity
- Recognize cognitive overload as a system failure

### 2. Psychological Safety
- Safe to share mistakes without blame
- Honest discussion → improvements
- Cognitive capacity drops 80% under stress - plan for it

### 3. Learning Culture
- Every incident = learning opportunity (Law 1: Failure)
- Share knowledge widely to distribute cognitive load (Law 5: Epistemology)
- Document learnings to offload from working memory

    section Detection Phase
        14:32 : 🚨 Alert triggered
                : Error rate spike to 15%
                : PagerDuty fired
        
        14:35 : 👤 On-call acknowledged
                : Initial assessment started
                : Slack channel created
    
    section Investigation Phase  
        14:40 : 🔍 Investigation began
                : Checked recent deployments
                : Analyzed error logs
        
        14:45 : 📊 Metrics correlation

        15:10 : 🔧 Fix deployed
                : Rolled back to v2.4.9
                : Monitoring intensified
    
    section Recovery Phase
        15:25 : ✅ System normal
                : Error rate < 0.1%
                : Performance restored
```

## Postmortem Process

### 1. Incident Timeline
```markdown
## Timeline
- 14:32 - Alert fired for high error rate
- 14:35 - On-call engineer acknowledged
- 14:40 - Initial investigation began
- 14:52 - Root cause identified
- 15:10 - Fix deployed
- 15:25 - System returned to normal
```

### 2. The Five Whys
```text
Problem: Service outage lasted 53 minutes

Why? → The service ran out of memory
Why? → Memory leak in new feature
Why? → Missing memory profiling in testing
Why? → No automated memory testing in CI
Why? → Performance testing not prioritized
```

### 3. Contributing Factors
- Technical factors (code, infrastructure)
- Process factors (testing, deployment)
- Communication factors (alerts, escalation)
- Documentation factors (runbooks, knowledge)

- Better testing coverage

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| Add memory monitoring | SRE Team | 2024-02-01 | In Progress |
| Update testing suite | Dev Team | 2024-02-15 | Not Started |


## Lessons Learned
[Key takeaways for the organization]
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Blame Game
❌ "John pushed bad code"
✅ "Our review process didn't catch the issue"

### 2. Single Root Cause
❌ "The database query was the root cause"
✅ "Multiple factors contributed: query optimization, lack of caching, missing alerts"

### 3. Individual Action Items
❌ "Sarah needs to be more careful"
✅ "We need automated checks to prevent this class of error"

## Creating Psychological Safety

1. **Leadership Example**: Leaders share mistakes
2. **No Punishment**: Honest mistakes unpunished
3. **Focus on Systems**: "How did system allow this?"
4. **Celebrate Learning**: Reward thorough postmortems

## Postmortem Metrics

- Time to complete
- Action items generated
- Action completion rate
- Repeat incident rate
- Team participation

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Database Outage
Instead of: "DBA forgot to add index"
We found: "Our schema change process lacked automated performance testing"

### Example 2: Config Error
Instead of: "Engineer pushed wrong config"
We found: "Config validation was manual, no automated checks for common errors"
