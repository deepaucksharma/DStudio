# [Company] [System Name] Architecture

## At a Glance

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Scale** | X users/requests | Growth rate, peak loads |
| **Data Volume** | X TB/PB | Daily growth, retention |
| **Availability** | 99.X% | SLA requirements |
| **Latency** | Xms p50, Yms p99 | User-facing vs internal |
| **Team Size** | X engineers | Organization structure |
| **Timeline** | Started YYYY | Major milestones |

## The Challenge

**In 2-3 sentences, describe the core problem this system solves.**

Example: Netflix needed to stream video content to 200M+ subscribers globally with <100ms startup time while handling 10x traffic spikes during popular show releases.

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Trade-offs | Impact |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Data Store** | NoSQL (Cassandra) | Consistency for availability | 99.99% uptime, eventual consistency |
| **Service Communication** | gRPC + Service Mesh | Complexity for observability | 50% latency reduction |
| **Caching Strategy** | Multi-tier (Edge + App) | Cost for performance | 90% cache hit rate |
| **Deployment** | Cell-based architecture | Operational complexity | Blast radius < 5% |

## Patterns Applied

| Pattern | Purpose | Implementation | Results |
|---------|---------|----------------|---------|
| [Circuit Breaker](/../pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker/index.md) | Prevent cascade failures | Hystrix → Resilience4j | 99.9% service availability |
| [CQRS](/../pattern-library/data-management/cqrs/index.md) | Read/write optimization | Separate read replicas | 10x read throughput |
| [Event Streaming](/../pattern-library/architecture/event-streaming/index.md) | Real-time processing | Kafka with 1000+ partitions | <100ms event processing |
| [Sharding](/../pattern-library/scaling/sharding/index.md) | Horizontal scaling | Hash-based on user_id | Linear scaling to 1B users |
