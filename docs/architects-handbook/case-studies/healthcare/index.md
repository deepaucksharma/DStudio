## üí° Key Takeaways

### **Healthcare-Specific Considerations**
1. **Compliance First**: Design architecture with regulations in mind from day one
2. **Patient Safety**: Implement redundancy and failover for life-critical systems
3. **Data Governance**: Establish clear data lineage and access controls
4. **Interoperability**: Use healthcare standards (FHIR, HL7) for system integration
5. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging is non-negotiable in healthcare

### **Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- **Security as an Afterthought**: Integrate security into every architectural decision
- **Monolithic Compliance**: Break down compliance requirements into modular components
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Design for interoperability and data portability
- **Ignoring Clinical Workflows**: Technology must support, not hinder, patient care
