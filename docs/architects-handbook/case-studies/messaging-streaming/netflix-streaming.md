## Design Deep Dive

### Data Architecture

!!! tip "Key Design Decisions"
 1. **Microservices Architecture**: 700+ independent services with clear ownership boundaries
 2. **Event-Driven Design**: Kafka-based event streaming for loose coupling and scalability 
 3. **Polyglot Persistence**: Multiple databases optimized for specific use cases (Cassandra, DynamoDB, MySQL)
 4. **Content Delivery Network**: Open Connect CDN with 15,000+ servers in ISP locations globally

## Failure Scenarios & Lessons

!!! danger "Major Incident: Christmas Eve 2012 AWS Outage"
 **What Happened**: AWS ELB service outage in US-East-1 took down Netflix streaming for several hours on Christmas Eve, affecting millions of users during peak viewing time.

 **Root Cause**: 
 - Single point of failure in AWS Elastic Load Balancer service
 - Netflix's dependency on single-region architecture at the time
 - Insufficient circuit breakers between critical services

 **Impact**: 
 - 6+ hours of streaming outages
 - Millions of users affected during holiday peak
 - Significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction
 - Public relations impact during high-visibility period

 **Lessons Learned**:
 1. **Embrace failure**: Led to development of chaos engineering practices and Chaos Monkey
 2. **Multi-region architecture**: Accelerated move to active-active multi-region deployment
 3. **Circuit breaker patterns**: Implemented comprehensive failure isolation mechanisms

### Circuit Breaker Pattern in Action

!!! info "Pattern Deep Dive: [Circuit Breaker](../pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker.md)"
    Netflix's Hystrix framework implements circuit breakers at massive scale, handling 100B+ requests daily. When a service fails, the circuit breaker opens to prevent cascading failures, allowing the system to degrade gracefully.

```java
/ Hystrix Command Example
@HystrixCommand(
    fallbackMethod = "getDefaultRecommendations",
    commandProperties = {
        @HystrixProperty(name = "circuitBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold", value = "20"),
        @HystrixProperty(name = "circuitBreaker.errorThresholdPercentage", value = "50"),
        @HystrixProperty(name = "circuitBreaker.sleepWindowInMilliseconds", value = "5000")
    }
)
public List<Movie> getRecommendations(String userId) {
    return recommendationService.getForUser(userId);
}
```

### Load Balancing at Scale

!!! info "Pattern Deep Dive: [Load Balancing](../pattern-library/scaling/load-balancing.md)"
    Zuul gateway performs intelligent load balancing across microservices, using real-time metrics to route requests to healthy instances.

| CDN Storage | 100+ PB | High hit ratio (95%+) |
| AWS Compute | 50,000+ instances | Auto-scaling based on demand |
| Network | 15% global traffic | Optimized through ISP partnerships |
| Content Processing | 1000s of hours/day | Parallel encoding pipelines |


## Operational Excellence

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Metrics**: Atlas time-series database with 2+ billion metrics per minute
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with real-time processing and alerting
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing across microservices for performance analysis
- **Alerting**: SLO-based alerting with automated incident response

### Deployment Strategy

!!! note
 **Deployment Frequency**: 4000+ deployments per day across all services
 **Rollout Strategy**: Canary deployments with automated rollback based on key metrics
 **Rollback Time**: < 10 minutes for critical services with automated rollback triggers
 **Feature Flags**: Extensive use for A/B testing and gradual feature rollouts

## Caching Strategy Deep Dive

!!! info "Pattern Deep Dive: [Caching Strategies](../pattern-library/scaling/caching-strategies.md)"
    Netflix's Open Connect CDN implements multi-level caching with 15,000+ edge servers globally, achieving 95%+ cache hit rates and reducing backbone traffic significantly.

### Cache Hierarchy

    end

```

## Key Innovations

1. **Chaos Engineering**: Pioneered systematic failure injection to build resilient systems

### Bronze Pattern Migration

<div class="migration-box">
<h4>âš¡ From Monolith to Microservices</h4>

Netflix started with a monolith and migrated to microservices over 3 years:

1. **2008**: Monolithic Java application
2. **2009**: Database issues force service extraction
3. **2010**: Move to AWS begins
4. **2011**: Full microservices architecture

**Key Learning**: Start simple, evolve when needed. The monolith served them well until scale demanded change.

[View Migration Playbook â†’](../architects-handbook/implementation-playbooks/migrations/monolith-to-microservices/)
</div>

## Takeaways for Your System

!!! quote "Key Lessons"
 1. **When to apply**: Microservices work well for large teams with clear service boundaries and independent deployment needs
 2. **When to avoid**: Don't start with microservices - begin with monolith and split when team size and complexity demand it
 3. **Cost considerations**: Expect 2-3x operational overhead but gain in development velocity and system resilience
 4. **Team requirements**: Need DevOps expertise, monitoring infrastructure, and culture that embraces failure
