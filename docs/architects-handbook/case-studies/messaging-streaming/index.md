# Messaging & Streaming Systems

Event-driven architectures and stream processing systems that handle trillions of messages daily.

## Overview

Modern distributed systems rely heavily on messaging and streaming for decoupling services, handling real-time data processing, and building resilient event-driven architectures. These case studies examine how companies build messaging platforms that can handle massive throughput while providing durability, ordering, and exactly-once semantics.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By studying these systems, you'll master:

- **Event Streaming** - Real-time data pipelines and stream processing
- **Message Durability** - Persistent queues, replication, and recovery

## üèóÔ∏è Messaging & Streaming Patterns

### Message Delivery Semantics
- **At-Most-Once** - Fast but may lose messages
- **At-Least-Once** - Reliable but may duplicate  
- **Exactly-Once** - Strong consistency, complex implementation
- **Idempotent Processing** - Safe message reprocessing

### Stream Processing Patterns
- **Windowing** - Time-based, count-based, session-based
- **Aggregations** - Real-time metrics, rollups, OLAP cubes
- **Joins** - Stream-stream, stream-table, temporal joins  
- **Pattern Detection** - Complex event processing, anomaly detection

### Ordering & Partitioning
- **Partition Key Selection** - Even distribution vs ordering requirements
- **Global Ordering** - Single partition bottleneck vs consistency
- **Causal Ordering** - Vector clocks, happened-before relationships
- **Partial Ordering** - Per-key ordering, business logic driven

### Fault Tolerance
- **Checkpointing** - State snapshots for failure recovery
- **Replay** - Reprocessing from last known good state  
- **Circuit Breaker** - Preventing cascading failures
- **Dead Letter Queues** - Handling poison messages
