# Strava Heatmaps Case Study

> ðŸš§ This case study is planned for future development.

## Overview
This case study would examine Strava's architecture for aggregating billions of GPS activities into global heatmaps, including the privacy challenges that led to exposing sensitive military locations.

## Key Challenges
- Processing billions of GPS tracks efficiently
- Aggregating activities while preserving privacy
- Differential privacy for sensitive locations
- Real-time heatmap generation and updates
- Privacy zones and activity obfuscation
- Balancing data utility with user privacy
