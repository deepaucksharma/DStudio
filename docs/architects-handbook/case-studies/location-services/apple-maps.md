# Apple Maps Case Study

> ðŸš§ This case study is planned for future development.

## Overview
This case study would examine Apple Maps' architecture with a focus on privacy-preserving techniques, on-device processing, and differential privacy for location analytics.

## Key Challenges
- Privacy-first architecture design
- On-device route calculation and caching
- Differential privacy for traffic data collection
- MapKit framework for developers
- Indoor mapping and ARKit integration
- Look Around (Street View alternative) infrastructure
