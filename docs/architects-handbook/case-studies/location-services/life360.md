# Life360 Case Study

> ðŸš§ This case study is planned for future development.

## Overview
This case study would analyze Life360's architecture for continuous family location tracking, including real-time updates, geofencing for arrival/departure notifications, and emergency features.

## Key Challenges
- Continuous background location tracking
- Battery optimization strategies
- Geofencing at scale for millions of locations
- Driving behavior detection and scoring
- Emergency SOS and crash detection
- Location history storage and privacy
