# Find My Device Case Study

> 🚧 This case study is planned for future development.

## Overview
This case study would examine the distributed architecture behind Apple's Find My network and Google's Find My Device, including privacy-preserving location reporting and crowd-sourced device finding. These systems demonstrate how to build a global-scale tracking network while maintaining user privacy through cryptographic techniques.

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Privacy-Preserving Architecture

         │          Only owner can decrypt               │
         └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Crowd-Sourced Network Scale
- **1 billion+ devices**: Global finder network
- **BLE range**: ~30-50 meters coverage
- **Urban density**: High probability of detection
- **Rural challenges**: Sparse network coverage

### 3. Battery Efficiency
| Component | Power Strategy | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| BLE Advertising | Duty cycling | <1% daily battery |
| Scanning | Opportunistic | Piggyback on other BLE |
| Reporting | Batched uploads | Reduce radio usage |
| Encryption | Hardware acceleration | Minimal CPU impact |


### 4. Anti-Stalking Measures
- **Unknown tracker alerts**: Notify if unfamiliar device travels with you
- **Sound alerts**: Trackers play sounds when separated from owner
- **NFC tap**: Identify found tracker owner (law enforcement)
- **Rotation timing**: Balance privacy vs anti-stalking detection
