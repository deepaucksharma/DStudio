# Global Matchmaking Systems

## System Overview

Modern multiplayer games require sophisticated matchmaking systems that pair millions of players into fair, engaging matches across the globe. These systems must consider skill levels, connection quality, game mode preferences, and social factors while minimizing wait times and maximizing match quality for games like League of Legends, Dota 2, and Overwatch.

### Scale & Complexity
- **Active Players**: 100M+ monthly active users
- **Daily Matches**: 50M+ matches created globally
- **Queue Processing**: 1M+ concurrent players in matchmaking queues
- **Regional Coverage**: 15+ global regions with sub-region optimization
- **Average Wait Time**: <2 minutes for 90% of players

## Key Architectural Challenges

### 1. Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM)

**Challenge**: Creating fair matches by accurately assessing player skill and predicting match outcomes.

**Solution Architecture**:
- Multi-dimensional skill assessment beyond simple win/loss
- Uncertainty-aware rating systems that adapt over time
- Machine learning for skill prediction and match outcome modeling
- Role-specific skill tracking for team-based games

**Implementation**:
```python

        // Fallback for long-waiting players
        q.handleLongWaitPlayers(skillQueue)
    }
}
```

### 3. Regional Optimization & Latency

**Challenge**: Minimizing connection latency while maintaining match quality across global player base.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
Regional Strategy:
  Primary Regions:

    - Europe West (Ireland)
    - Europe Nordic & East (Stockholm)
    - Asia Pacific (Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo)
    - Brazil (São Paulo)
    - Oceania (Sydney)
  
  Latency Optimization:
    - Player geo-location detection
    - ISP routing quality analysis
    - Real-time latency measurement
    - Dynamic server selection
    
  Cross-Region Fallback:
    - Triggered after 3+ minute wait
