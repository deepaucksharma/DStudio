## Technical Deep Dive

### Indexing Pipeline

=== "Crawling"
    ```python
    # Simplified crawler logic
    class GoogleCrawler:
        def crawl(self, seed_urls):
            frontier = PriorityQueue(seed_urls)
            
            while not frontier.empty():
                url = frontier.get()
                if self.should_crawl(url):
                    content = self.fetch(url)
                    new_urls = self.extract_links(content)
                    frontier.extend(new_urls)
                    self.store_content(url, content)
    ```

=== "MapReduce Processing"
    ```python
    # Inverted index building
    def map(doc_id, content):
        words = tokenize(content)
        for word in words:
            emit(word, doc_id)
    
    def reduce(word, doc_ids):
        posting_list = compress(doc_ids)
        emit(word, posting_list)
    ```

=== "Query Serving"
    ```python
    # Query processing pipeline
    def search(query):
        # Check cache first
        if result := cache.get(query):
            return result
        
        # Parse and expand query
        terms = parse_query(query)
        synonyms = expand_terms(terms)
        
        # Retrieve postings
        postings = index.get_postings(synonyms)
        
        # Rank results
        results = rank_documents(postings)
        
        # Cache and return
        cache.set(query, results)
        return results
    ```

### Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Impact | Implementation |
|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Distributed Caching** | 90% queries from cache | Multi-level cache hierarchy |
| **Index Compression** | 10x storage reduction | Custom compression algorithms |

| **Early Termination** | 50% latency reduction | Stop after enough results |
| **Proximity Routing** | 30% latency reduction | Anycast to nearest DC |

## Scaling Challenges

        B1 -."Weeks".-> S1
    end
    
    subgraph "New: Caffeine"
        C2[Continuous Crawl] --> I2[Incremental Index]
        I2 --> S2[Real-time Serving]
        I2 -."Minutes".-> S2
    end
    
    style B1 fill:#ffcdd2
    style I2 fill:#c8e6c9
```

### Challenge 2: Global Consistency
