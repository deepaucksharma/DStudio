# Case Studies

Learn from real distributed systems implementations at scale.

## Overview

These case studies examine how leading technology companies have built and evolved their distributed systems. Each study provides:

- **Architecture Overview** - System design and components
- **Key Challenges** - Problems faced at scale
- **Solutions Applied** - Patterns and techniques used
- **Lessons Learned** - What worked and what didn't
- **Current State** - How the system has evolved

## üìö Featured Case Studies

### Streaming & Content Delivery
- **[Netflix Streaming Platform](netflix-streaming.md)** - 260M+ users, microservices, chaos engineering

### Transportation & Logistics
- **[Uber Location Services](uber-location.md)** - Real-time geo-distributed system serving 40M+ users

### Databases & Storage
- **[Amazon DynamoDB](amazon-dynamodb.md)** - Distributed NoSQL database handling 10T+ requests/day
- **[Google Spanner](google-spanner.md)** - Globally distributed relational database with external consistency
- **[Redis Architecture](redis.md)** - In-memory data structure store with sub-millisecond latency
- **[Cassandra](cassandra.md)** - Wide-column distributed database for high write throughput

### Messaging & Streaming
- **[Apache Kafka](kafka.md)** - Distributed streaming platform processing trillions of events/day

### Financial Systems
- **[Payment System Architecture](payment-system.md)** - Building reliable payment processing at scale

## üéØ By Problem Domain

### Scale Challenges
- Netflix: 260M+ concurrent users, 1B+ hours/month
- Uber: 40M+ active users, 100M+ location updates/day
- DynamoDB: 10T+ requests/day across millions of tables
- Kafka: Processing trillions of events daily

### Consistency Challenges
- Google Spanner: External consistency with TrueTime
- Amazon DynamoDB: Tunable consistency (eventual to strong)
- Cassandra: Eventually consistent with tunable quorum
- Payment Systems: ACID guarantees for financial transactions

### Latency Challenges
- Redis: Sub-millisecond response times
- Uber Location: 200ms p99 for global queries
- Netflix: 50ms startup time for video streaming
- DynamoDB: Single-digit millisecond latency

## üìä Pattern Usage

| Company/System | Key Patterns Used |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Netflix** | Circuit Breaker (Hystrix), Event Sourcing, CQRS, Multi-level Cache, Chaos Engineering |
| **Uber** | Geospatial Indexing (H3), Event Streaming, Edge Computing, Adaptive Sampling |
| **DynamoDB** | Consistent Hashing, Quorum Consensus, Vector Clocks, Merkle Trees, Auto-scaling |
| **Spanner** | Paxos, TrueTime, Multi-Version Concurrency Control, Distributed Transactions |
| **Kafka** | Partitioning, Replication, Log-structured Storage, Zero-copy |
| **Redis** | Master-Slave Replication, Sharding, Pub/Sub, Persistence Options |
| **Cassandra** | Consistent Hashing, Gossip Protocol, LSM Trees, Bloom Filters |

## üîç How to Use These Studies

1. **Identify Similar Challenges** - Find systems facing your scalability, consistency, or latency problems
2. **Study Their Evolution** - Understand their journey from simple to complex architectures
3. **Extract Patterns** - Identify reusable patterns and their trade-offs
4. **Learn from Failures** - Each case study includes lessons from production incidents
5. **Adapt to Your Context** - Consider your specific constraints before applying solutions

## üìà Scale Comparison

| System | Scale Metrics | Architecture Highlights |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Netflix** | 260M users, 100PB+ data | 700+ microservices, Open Connect CDN |
| **Uber** | 15M+ daily rides, 40M+ users | H3 spatial index, edge computing |
| **DynamoDB** | 10T+ requests/day | Multi-region, auto-scaling |
| **Spanner** | 1000s of nodes globally | Synchronized clocks, 5 9s availability |
| **Kafka** | 7T+ messages/day at LinkedIn | Distributed commit log, horizontal scaling |
| **Redis** | 1M+ ops/sec single instance | In-memory, multiple data structures |
| **Cassandra** | 1M+ writes/sec cluster | Wide-column, eventual consistency |
