# Video Streaming Platform Architecture

> ðŸš§ This case study is planned for future development.

## Overview
This case study would explore the architecture of large-scale video streaming platforms like Netflix, focusing on:
- Global content delivery networks (CDN)
- Adaptive bitrate streaming
- Video encoding and transcoding pipelines
- Multi-region content caching
- Personalized content recommendations
- Real-time streaming analytics

## Key Challenges
- Delivering 4K/8K content globally with low latency
- Handling millions of concurrent streams
- Dynamic content adaptation based on network conditions
- Regional content licensing and geo-blocking
- Efficient video compression and storage
- Peak traffic management (new releases, live events)
