# Implementation Playbooks

Step-by-step guides for implementing distributed systems patterns in production.

## Overview

These playbooks provide detailed, actionable guidance for implementing distributed systems patterns. Each playbook includes:

- **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
- **Step-by-Step Instructions** - Detailed implementation guide
- **Testing Strategies** - How to verify correctness
- **Rollout Plans** - Safe deployment approaches
- **Rollback Procedures** - How to recover from issues
- **Success Metrics** - How to measure impact

## üìö Migration Playbooks

### System Transformations
- **[Monolith to Microservices](../monolith-to-microservices.md)** - Decompose safely without disruption
- **[On-Premise to Cloud](on-premise-to-cloud/)** - Cloud migration strategies
- **[Single to Multi-Region](single-to-multi-region/)** - Global expansion guide
- **[Synchronous to Asynchronous](sync-to-async/)** - Event-driven transformation

### Data Migrations
- **[RDBMS to NoSQL](rdbms-to-nosql/)** - Database migration patterns
- **[Single to Sharded Database](database-sharding/)** - Horizontal partitioning
- **[Cache Integration](cache-integration/)** - Adding caching layers
- **[Event Sourcing Adoption](event-sourcing-adoption/)** - Event-based architecture

## üõ†Ô∏è Pattern Implementation

### Resilience Patterns
- **[Circuit Breaker Implementation](circuit-breaker-setup/)** - Prevent cascade failures
- **[Retry with Backoff](retry-implementation/)** - Handle transient failures
- **[Bulkhead Pattern](bulkhead-setup/)** - Resource isolation
- **[Health Checks](health-check-implementation/)** - Service monitoring

### Scaling Patterns
- **[Load Balancer Setup](load-balancer-setup/)** - Traffic distribution
- **[Auto-scaling Configuration](auto-scaling-setup/)** - Dynamic capacity
- **[CDN Integration](cdn-integration/)** - Edge caching
- **[Database Read Replicas](read-replica-setup/)** - Read scaling

## üìã Operational Readiness

### Pre-Production Checklists
- **[Launch Readiness](launch-readiness/)** - Before going live
- **[Security Review](security-checklist/)** - Security considerations
- **[Performance Testing](../performance-testing.md)** - Load and stress testing
- **[Disaster Recovery](disaster-recovery/)** - Backup and recovery plans

### Production Operations
- **[Monitoring Setup](monitoring-setup/)** - Observability implementation
- **[Alerting Strategy](alerting-strategy/)** - Effective notifications
- **[Runbook Templates](runbook-templates/)** - Operational procedures
- **[Incident Response](../incident-response.md)** - Handling outages

## üéØ Quick Start Guides

| Goal | Playbook | Difficulty | Time |
|------|----------|------------|------|
| Add caching | [Cache Integration](cache-integration/) | Medium | 1-2 weeks |
| Improve resilience | [Circuit Breaker Setup](circuit-breaker-setup/) | Easy | 2-3 days |
| Scale reads | [Read Replica Setup](read-replica-setup/) | Medium | 1 week |
| Go multi-region | [Multi-Region Guide](single-to-multi-region/) | Hard | 2-3 months |

## üìä Success Stories

### Monolith Decomposition
- **Company A**: 6-month migration, 70% latency reduction
- **Company B**: 1-year migration, 10x scale capability
- **Company C**: 3-month partial migration, 50% cost savings

### Multi-Region Expansion
- **E-commerce Platform**: 3 regions, 99.99% availability
- **SaaS Provider**: 5 regions, <100ms global latency
- **Gaming Company**: 8 regions, seamless failover
