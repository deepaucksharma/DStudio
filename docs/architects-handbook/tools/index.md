# Interactive Tools & Calculators

## Overview

These interactive tools transform the mathematical principles from our [Quantitative Analysis Toolkit](../quantitative-analysis/index.md) into practical calculators for real-world architectural decisions. Each tool provides immediate feedback on system design trade-offs with production-validated formulas.

## üìä Performance & Capacity Planning

### Core Performance Tools

<div class="tools-grid">

- **[‚è±Ô∏è Latency Calculator](latency-calculator.md)** - Calculate end-to-end latency, network delays, and response times using Little's Law and queueing theory
- **[üìà Capacity Planning Calculator](capacity-calculator.md)** - Plan resource allocation, predict scaling needs, and optimize throughput based on workload patterns  
- **[üöÄ Throughput Optimizer](throughput-calculator.md)** - Find optimal batch sizes, concurrency levels, and pipeline configurations for maximum throughput

</div>

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Availability

<div class="tools-grid">

- **[‚úÖ Availability Calculator](availability-calculator.md)** - Calculate system availability, MTBF, MTTR, and the impact of redundancy on uptime
- **[‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Probability Estimator](../quantitative-analysis/reliability-theory.md)** - Analyze failure modes and calculate system reliability
- **[üîÑ Replication Strategy Planner](../quantitative-analysis/consistency-models.md)** - Compare replication strategies and consistency guarantees

</div>

### üí∞ Cost & Economics

<div class="tools-grid">

- **[üíµ Cost Optimization Calculator](cost-optimizer.md)** - Compare on-premise vs cloud costs, calculate TCO, and find optimal resource allocation
- **[üìä Architecture ROI Calculator](../quantitative-analysis/storage-economics.md)** - Calculate return on investment for architectural improvements
- **[üíæ Storage Economics Calculator](../quantitative-analysis/storage-economics.md)** - Optimize storage costs across different tiers and providers

</div>

### üéØ Decision Support

<div class="tools-grid">

- **[üîÑ Consistency Calculator](../quantitative-analysis/consistency-models.md)** - Explore CAP theorem trade-offs, calculate consistency guarantees, and compare consistency models
- **[üóÇÔ∏è Partition Strategy Simulator](../quantitative-analysis/sharding-strategies.md)** - Model different sharding approaches and their performance characteristics
- **[üì• Queue Analyzer](../quantitative-analysis/queueing-networks.md)** - Analyze queue behavior, predict wait times, and optimize queue configurations

</div>

## Quick Links to Theory

Each calculator is based on solid mathematical foundations:

- **[Little's Law](../quantitative-analysis/littles-law.md)** - Foundation for latency and throughput calculations
- **[Queueing Theory](../quantitative-analysis/queueing-theory.md)** - Models for performance analysis
- **[Availability Math](../quantitative-analysis/reliability-theory.md)** - Reliability calculations
- **[CAP Theorem](../quantitative-analysis/cap-theorem.md)** - Consistency trade-offs
- **[Universal Scalability Law](../quantitative-analysis/universal-scalability.md)** - Scaling predictions

## How to Use These Tools

1. **Start with your requirements** - What are you trying to optimize?
2. **Input your current metrics** - Use real data from your systems
3. **Explore scenarios** - Try different configurations
4. **Validate with theory** - Check against the mathematical models
5. **Make informed decisions** - Use results to guide architecture choices

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
 Combine multiple calculators for comprehensive analysis. For example:
 
 1. Use the **Latency Calculator** to understand response times
 2. Feed results into the **Capacity Calculator** for resource planning
 3. Use both in the **Cost Optimizer** for budget analysis

## Coming Soon

- ** Observability Cost Calculator** - Balance monitoring coverage vs cost
- ** Interactive System Simulator** - Play with distributed system behaviors
- ** Mobile-Optimized Versions** - All tools accessible on mobile devices
