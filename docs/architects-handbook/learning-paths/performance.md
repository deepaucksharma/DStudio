## üí° Performance Best Practices

!!! tip "Performance Wisdom"
 1. **Measure First**: Never optimize without data
 2. **80/20 Rule**: Focus on the biggest bottlenecks
 3. **Cache Everything**: But invalidate carefully
 4. **Async When Possible**: Don't block on I/O
 5. **Monitor Always**: You can't improve what you don't measure
