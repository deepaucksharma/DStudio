## 💡 Platform Engineering Principles

!!! quote "Guiding Principles for Platform Success"
    **"Platforms are products, developers are users"** - Build with user-centric design
    
    **"Make the right way the easy way"** - Golden paths should be the obvious choice
    
    **"Measure what matters to developers"** - Focus on outcome metrics, not activity
    
    **"Start small, scale gradually"** - Begin with high-impact, low-complexity solutions

### Core Platform Values

1. **Developer-Centric**: Every decision optimizes for developer experience
2. **Self-Service First**: Enable independence while providing guidance
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
4. **Measure and Iterate**: Use data to drive continuous improvement
5. **Community-Driven**: Build with developers, not for developers

### Platform Engineering Mantras

- **"You build it, you run it"** - Platform teams enable, don't replace ownership
- **"Boring is beautiful"** - Reliable, predictable platforms scale better
- **"Automate the mundane"** - Let developers focus on business value
- **"Security by design"** - Build security in, don't bolt it on
- **"Document the why"** - Explain decisions, not just procedures
