## 💡 ML Infrastructure Principles

!!! quote "Principles for Production ML Excellence"
    **"Machine learning is software engineering plus data"** - Build with software best practices
    
    **"Models are code, data is infrastructure"** - Treat data with the same care as code
    
    **"Fail fast in training, never in production"** - Extensive validation before deployment
    
    **"Optimize for the team, not just the model"** - Developer productivity matters

### Core ML Infrastructure Values

1. **Reproducibility First**: Every experiment must be reproducible
2. **Data Quality**: Garbage in, garbage out - no exceptions
3. **Monitoring Everything**: ML systems fail silently without monitoring  
4. **Cost Consciousness**: GPU time is expensive - optimize relentlessly
5. **Security by Design**: AI systems are attractive targets - secure by default

### ML Infrastructure Mantras

- **"Version everything"** - Models, data, code, and configurations
- **"Test in production"** - A/B testing is essential for ML systems
- **"Monitor business metrics"** - Technical metrics don't always correlate with business value
- **"Plan for model decay"** - All models degrade over time
- **"Democratize ML"** - Make machine learning accessible to all engineers
