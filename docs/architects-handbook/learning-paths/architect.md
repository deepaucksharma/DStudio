- Communicate complex architectures to diverse stakeholders

## üìö Prerequisites

- 7+ years of software engineering experience
- 3+ years designing distributed systems
- Experience with multiple cloud platforms
- Strong understanding of enterprise architecture
- Business acumen and stakeholder management skills
