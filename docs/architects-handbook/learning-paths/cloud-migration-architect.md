## 💡 Success Tips & Best Practices

### Learning Strategies

!!! tip "Maximize Your Cloud Migration Mastery"
    - **Think Enterprise-Scale**: Always consider migrations in terms of hundreds of applications
    - **Practice Crisis Management**: Run failure simulations regularly
    - **Build Financial Acumen**: Master cloud economics and cost optimization
    - **Network with Practitioners**: Join cloud migration communities

### Common Migration Pitfalls

!!! warning "Learn from Migration Failures"
    - **Underestimating Dependencies**: Always map application interdependencies thoroughly
    - **Ignoring Data Gravity**: Data location drives architecture decisions
    - **Rushing to Refactor**: Sometimes lift-and-shift is the right first step
    - **Neglecting Change Management**: Technology change requires people change
    - **Skipping Governance**: Establish cloud policies before mass migration
