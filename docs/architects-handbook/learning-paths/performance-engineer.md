## 💡 Performance Mastery Strategies

### Optimization Methodologies

!!! tip "Systematic Performance Engineering"
    - **Measure First**: Never optimize without measurement and profiling
    - **Focus on Bottlenecks**: Apply 80/20 rule - identify the critical 20%
    - **Understand Trade-offs**: Every optimization has costs and benefits
    - **Think End-to-End**: Consider entire system, not just individual components
    - **Validate with Statistics**: Ensure improvements are statistically significant

### Common Performance Pitfalls

!!! warning "Avoid These Optimization Mistakes"
    - **Premature Optimization**: Optimize after measurement, not before
    - **Micro-optimizations**: Focus on algorithmic improvements first
    - **Ignoring Caching**: Poor cache usage often dominates performance
    - **Lock Contention**: Excessive locking kills scalability
    - **Memory Allocation**: Frequent allocation/deallocation creates overhead
