# Consistency & Coordination Learning Path

!!! abstract "Master Distributed Agreement"
 This focused path covers everything you need to know about consistency in distributed systems - from theoretical foundations to practical implementations. Perfect for engineers working on distributed databases, coordination services, or transactional systems.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this path, you will:

- Understand consistency models and their trade-offs
- Implement consensus algorithms and coordination patterns
- Design systems with appropriate consistency guarantees
- Handle distributed transactions and state management
- Debug and resolve consistency issues in production

## üìö Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic distributed systems concepts
- Experience with databases and transactions
- Familiarity with concurrent programming
- Basic knowledge of networking

## üó∫Ô∏è Consistency Journey

### Phase 1: Theoretical Foundations (1 week)

!!! info "Build Strong Foundations"
 Start with the theory that underpins all consistency mechanisms.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **Core Concepts**
 
 Essential theory:
 
 - [CAP Theorem](quantitative/cap-theorem) - Fundamental trade-offs
 - [Consistency Models](quantitative/consistency-models) - From strong to eventual
 - [PACELC Theorem](quantitative/cap-theorem) - Extended CAP analysis

- **Distributed Time**
 
 Understanding ordering:
 
 - [Logical Clocks](../pattern-library/coordination/logical-clocks) - Lamport timestamps
 - [Vector Clocks](../pattern-library/coordination/vector-clocks) - Causality tracking
 - [Hybrid Logical Clocks](../pattern-library/coordination/hlc) - Best of both worlds

### Phase 2: Consensus Algorithms (2 weeks)

!!! warning "The Heart of Coordination"
 Master the algorithms that enable distributed agreement.

#### Week 2: Classical Consensus

 - Safety properties
 - **Project**: Implement Raft in your language

=== "Paxos"
 The original consensus algorithm:
 - Basic Paxos protocol
 - Multi-Paxos optimization
 - Practical considerations
 - **Project**: Build a Paxos-based lock service

=== "Byzantine Consensus"
 Tolerating malicious failures:
 - PBFT algorithm
 - Blockchain consensus
 - BFT-SMaRT
 - **Project**: Simple blockchain implementation

#### Week 3: Coordination Patterns

- [Leader Election](../pattern-library/coordination/leader-election) - Choosing coordinators
- [Distributed Lock](../pattern-library/coordination/distributed-lock) - Mutual exclusion
- [Consensus](../pattern-library/coordination/consensus) - Agreement protocols
- [Two-Phase Commit](../pattern-library/coordination/two-phase-commit) - Atomic commits

### Phase 3: Consistency in Practice (2 weeks)

!!! success "Real-World Applications"
 Apply consistency concepts to production systems.

#### Week 4: Data Consistency

=== "Strong Consistency"
 When you need guarantees:
 - Linearizability implementation
 - Serializable transactions
 - External consistency (Spanner)
 - **Case Study**: [Google Spanner](../google-spanner)

=== "Tunable Consistency"
 Flexible guarantees:
 - Read/write quorums
 - Consistency levels (Cassandra)

=== "Eventual Consistency"
 Convergence over time:
 - Anti-entropy protocols
 - Gossip dissemination
 - Conflict resolution

## üìà Consistency Decision Framework

### Choosing Consistency Levels

| Use Case | Consistency Level | Rationale |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Financial transactions | Strong | ACID requirements |
| User profiles | Eventual | Read-heavy, updates rare |
| Inventory management | Tunable | Balance availability/accuracy |
| Analytics data | Weak | Approximations acceptable |
| Session data | Session | User-specific guarantees |
