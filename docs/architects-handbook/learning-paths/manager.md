## üí° Management Best Practices

!!! tip "Effective Leadership"
 1. **Ask Good Questions**: "What happens if this component fails?"
 2. **Focus on Trade-offs**: No solution is perfect
 3. **Think in Budgets**: Latency, error, and cost budgets
 4. **Plan for Growth**: 10x current scale
 5. **Invest in Observability**: You can't manage what you can't measure

## üöÄ Next Steps

After completing this path:

1. **Deeper Dive**: Explore [Senior Engineer Path](../....../architects-handbook/learning-paths.md/senior-engineer.md) for technical depth
2. **Specialization**: Focus on specific domains (FinTech, Gaming, etc.)
3. **Strategic Leadership**: Move towards director/VP roles
4. **Cross-Functional**: Work with product and business teams

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Commitment

- **Total Duration**: 8-10 weeks
- **Weekly Commitment**: 5-8 hours
- **Total Time**: ~60-80 hours
- **Ongoing**: 2-3 hours/week staying current

Remember: Great engineering managers balance technical knowledge with people leadership.
