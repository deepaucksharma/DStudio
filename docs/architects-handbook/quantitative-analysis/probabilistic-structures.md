# Probabilistic Data Structures

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Mathematical analysis of probabilistic data structures that trade accuracy for space efficiency.

## Key Concepts
- Bloom filters and false positive rates
- Count-Min Sketch for frequency estimation
- HyperLogLog for cardinality estimation
- MinHash for similarity detection
- Cuckoo filters for deletable Bloom filters

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Distributed caching (cache membership)
- Rate limiting (frequency counting)
- Deduplication systems
- Analytics and monitoring
