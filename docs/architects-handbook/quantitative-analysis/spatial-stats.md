# Spatial Statistics

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Spatial statistics provides mathematical frameworks for analyzing geographic data, spatial clustering, and location-based patterns in distributed systems.

## Key Concepts
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I, Geary's C)
- Point pattern analysis
- Spatial clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, K-means)
- Hot spot detection (Getis-Ord Gi*)
- Spatial interpolation methods

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Location-based service optimization
- Geographically distributed data centers
- Content delivery network placement
- Proximity service design
- Geographic load balancing
