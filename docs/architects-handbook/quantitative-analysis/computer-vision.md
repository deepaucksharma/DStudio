## Overview
Computer vision models provide mathematical frameworks for image processing, feature extraction, and visual understanding in distributed systems that handle visual data.

## Key Concepts
- Image filtering and convolution
- Feature detection and matching
- Object detection and recognition
- Image segmentation
- Optical flow and motion estimation
- Deep learning for vision

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Distributed image processing pipelines
- Content-based image retrieval
- Video streaming optimization
- Edge computing for vision tasks
- Map tile generation and processing
