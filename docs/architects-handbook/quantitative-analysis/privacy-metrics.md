# Privacy Metrics

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Privacy metrics provide quantitative measures for data anonymization, privacy preservation, and information disclosure risk in distributed systems.

## Key Concepts
- K-anonymity: Each record is indistinguishable from k-1 others
- L-diversity: Well-represented sensitive attributes
- T-closeness: Distribution similarity measures
- Differential privacy: Mathematical privacy guarantees
- Information loss metrics

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Location-based service privacy
- Database anonymization
- Privacy-preserving analytics
- Federated learning privacy
- GDPR compliance metrics
