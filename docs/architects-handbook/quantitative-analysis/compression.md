# Compression Algorithms

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Compression algorithms reduce data size for efficient storage and transmission in distributed systems, balancing compression ratio, speed, and computational cost.

## Key Concepts
- Lossless vs lossy compression
- Entropy coding (Huffman, arithmetic)
- Dictionary-based compression (LZ77, LZW)
- Transform coding (DCT, wavelet)
- Compression ratios and benchmarks
- Real-time compression trade-offs

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Network bandwidth optimization
- Storage cost reduction
- Database compression (columnar, page-level)
- Log file compression
- Message queue optimization
