# Time-Series Analysis

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Time-series analysis provides mathematical techniques for understanding temporal patterns, trends, and making predictions based on historical data in distributed systems.

## Key Concepts
- Trend analysis and decomposition
- Seasonality detection
- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation
- ARIMA models
- Exponential smoothing
- Anomaly detection in time series

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Traffic pattern prediction
- Capacity planning and forecasting
- Performance anomaly detection
- Resource usage optimization
- SLA violation prediction
