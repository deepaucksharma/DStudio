# Social Networks

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Social network models analyze the structure and dynamics of social graphs, including friend relationships, influence propagation, and network effects in distributed systems.

## Key Concepts
- Graph centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness)
- Small-world networks and six degrees of separation
- Power law distributions in social graphs
- Community detection algorithms
- Influence propagation models

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Friend recommendation systems
- Social feed ranking
- Viral content distribution
- Privacy circles and access control
- Distributed social networks
