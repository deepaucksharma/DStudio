# Computational Geometry

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Computational geometry provides algorithms and data structures for solving geometric problems efficiently, essential for location-based services and spatial databases.

## Key Concepts
- Convex hull algorithms
- Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation
- Range searching and point location
- Geometric intersection problems
- Space-partitioning data structures (R-trees, Quad-trees)

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Geospatial indexing in databases
- Map rendering and projections
- Collision detection in simulations
- Geographic query optimization
- Spatial join operations
