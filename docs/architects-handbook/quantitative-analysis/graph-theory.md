# Graph Theory

> ðŸš§ This quantitative model documentation is under construction.

## Overview
Graph theory provides fundamental mathematical tools for analyzing network structures, connectivity, and algorithms in distributed systems.

## Key Concepts
- Graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, A*)
- Minimum spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim)
- Network flow algorithms
- Graph coloring and partitioning

## Applications in Distributed Systems
- Network routing protocols
- Database query optimization
- Distributed consensus algorithms
- Load balancing strategies
- Service dependency analysis
