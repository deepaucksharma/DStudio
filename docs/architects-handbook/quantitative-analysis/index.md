## ðŸ“ˆ Real-World Applications

### Case Study: E-commerce Platform
- Peak load: 100K requests/second
- Latency target: <200ms p99
- Availability: 99.95%
- **Solution**: 50 servers with 70% utilization

### Case Study: Video Streaming
- Concurrent users: 1M
- Bandwidth: 5 Mbps/user
- Cache hit ratio: 80%
- **Solution**: 100 edge nodes, 20 origin servers

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

### Key Formulas

| Metric | Formula | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Little's Law | L = Î» Ã— W | Queue sizing |
| Availability | A = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR) | SLA planning |
| Utilization | U = Î» / Î¼ | Resource planning |
| Throughput | X = N / T | Capacity planning |

### Rules of Thumb
- **80/20 Rule**: 80% of load from 20% of users
- **2x Headroom**: Plan for 2x expected peak
- **Rule of 3**: 3x redundancy for critical paths
- **70% Utilization**: Target for stable operation
