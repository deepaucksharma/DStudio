## Overview

The latency calculator is a specialized tool designed to help architects and engineers estimate end-to-end response times in distributed systems. This calculator considers various factors including network latency, service processing times, database query execution, serialization overhead, and queue waiting times to provide realistic performance projections. It enables teams to make informed decisions about system architecture, service placement, and performance optimization strategies.


## Prerequisites

To effectively use the latency calculator, users should understand distributed systems architecture, network fundamentals, database performance characteristics, and basic performance profiling concepts. Knowledge of service-oriented architecture, API design patterns, and common performance bottlenecks in distributed systems will help in making accurate estimations and interpreting results.


## Steps

Using the latency calculator involves identifying all system components in the request path, measuring or estimating individual component processing times, accounting for network latency between services, considering serialization and deserialization overhead, factoring in potential queueing delays, and analyzing the results to identify optimization opportunities and architectural improvements.
