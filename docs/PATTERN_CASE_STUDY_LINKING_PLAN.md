# Pattern-Case Study Bidirectional Linking Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the systematic approach to add bidirectional links between patterns and case studies in the DStudio documentation.

## Current State Analysis

### Gold Patterns Analyzed (5 patterns)
1. **Circuit Breaker** - Has embedded examples but no links to dedicated case studies
2. **Event Sourcing** - Has company mentions but no case study links
3. **Load Balancing** - Has failure stories but no case study links
4. **Caching Strategies** - Has examples but no case study links
5. **Saga Pattern** - Has detailed examples but no case study links

### Case Studies State
- Many are stubs (e.g., `/case-studies/netflix-chaos.md`)
- Elite engineering case studies are more complete (e.g., `/case-studies/elite-engineering/netflix-chaos-engineering.md`)
- Case studies don't link back to patterns they demonstrate

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Add Case Studies Section to Gold Patterns
For each gold pattern, add a dedicated "Case Studies" section with this structure:

```markdown
## Case Studies

### Real-World Implementations
- **[Netflix Hystrix: Circuit Breakers at Scale](../case-studies/elite-engineering/netflix-chaos-engineering.md)** - 100B+ requests/day
- **[Amazon Prime Day: Preventing Cascade Failures](../case-studies/amazon-prime-day.md)** - 10x traffic handling
- **[Uber Microservices: Service Protection](../case-studies/uber-location.md)** - 20M+ rides/day

### Learning from Failures
- **[GitHub 2018 Outage](../case-studies/github-outage-2018.md)** - How missing circuit breakers caused 24hr downtime
- **[AWS S3 2017](../case-studies/aws-s3-outage.md)** - Cascade failure analysis
```

### Phase 2: Update Case Studies to Link Back
For each case study, add a "Patterns Demonstrated" section:

```markdown
## Patterns Demonstrated

This case study demonstrates the following patterns in production:

### Core Patterns
- **[Circuit Breaker](../patterns/circuit-breaker.md)** - Hystrix prevents cascade failures
- **[Bulkhead](../patterns/bulkhead.md)** - Thread pool isolation
- **[Timeout](../patterns/timeout.md)** - Request timeout management

### Supporting Patterns
- **[Service Mesh](../patterns/service-mesh.md)** - Modern implementation
- **[Health Checks](../patterns/health-check.md)** - Service health monitoring
```

### Phase 3: Create Missing Case Studies
Priority case studies to create or enhance:
1. Amazon Prime Day resilience
2. Uber trip booking saga
3. Facebook TAO caching
4. Google Maglev load balancing
5. PayPal event sourcing

### Phase 4: Add Navigation Helpers
1. Add "See Case Studies" button at top of each pattern
2. Add "See Patterns" button at top of each case study
3. Update pattern catalog to show case study count
4. Create case study catalog organized by pattern

## Specific Actions by Pattern

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Add links to:**
- Netflix Hystrix case study ✓
- Amazon Prime Day case study
- GitHub 2018 outage
- Uber microservices

**Case studies should link back from:**
- netflix-chaos-engineering.md
- amazon-dynamodb-evolution.md

### Event Sourcing Pattern
**Add links to:**
- Walmart inventory system
- PayPal transaction history
- Banking implementations

**Create/enhance case studies:**
- walmart-inventory.md
- paypal-payments.md (enhance existing)

### Load Balancing Pattern
**Add links to:**
- Google Maglev
- AWS ELB evolution
- Cloudflare global LB
- GitHub LB failure

**Create/enhance case studies:**
- google-systems/google-maglev.md
- github-outage-2018.md

### Caching Strategies Pattern
**Add links to:**
- Facebook TAO
- Netflix EVCache
- Reddit front page
- Twitter timeline

**Create/enhance case studies:**
- facebook-tao.md
- reddit-architecture.md

### Saga Pattern
**Add links to:**
- Uber trip booking
- Airbnb reservations
- Amazon order processing
- Booking.com

**Create/enhance case studies:**
- uber-trip-saga.md
- airbnb-booking.md

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 38 gold patterns have case study sections
- [ ] All case studies link back to relevant patterns
- [ ] At least 2-3 case studies per gold pattern
- [ ] Pattern catalog shows case study counts
- [ ] Case study catalog organized by pattern

## Timeline
- Week 1: Add case study sections to 10 gold patterns
- Week 2: Add case study sections to remaining gold patterns
- Week 3: Update existing case studies with pattern links
- Week 4: Create high-priority missing case studies

- [GitHub's 2018 Lesson](../case-studies/failures/github-2018.md)
- [Stripe's Payment Protection](../case-studies/stripe-api-excellence.md#resilience)
```

## Notes
- Prioritize linking to existing complete case studies first
- Create stubs for missing case studies with clear TODOs
- Ensure all links are relative and working
- Add visual elements (diagrams) showing pattern usage in case studies
