## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity through Simplicity
Every design decision serves the learner's journey. We remove complexity that doesn't add value.

### 2. Consistent Rhythm
8-point spatial grid and systematic sizing create predictable, harmonious layouts.

### 3. Visual Excellence
Pixel-perfect implementation with attention to detail in every interaction.

### 4. Performance as Design
Fast loading and smooth interactions are part of the design, not afterthoughts.

### 5. Evolution through Improvement
The system is designed to grow and adapt based on user needs and feedback.
