## üéØ Interview Process

### 1. Problem Understanding (5-10 min)
- Clarify requirements
- Define scope
- Identify constraints
- Establish success metrics

### 2. High-Level Design (10-15 min)
- Draw architecture diagram
- Identify major components
- Define interfaces
- Show data flow

### 3. Detailed Design (20-30 min)
- Deep dive into components
- Discuss data models
- Explain algorithms
- Address bottlenecks

### 4. Scale & Optimize (10-15 min)
- Handle growth
- Optimize performance
- Ensure reliability
- Consider cost

## üìä Common Topics

### System Types
| Category | Examples | Key Challenges |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Social Media | Twitter, Instagram | Scale, feed generation |
| Messaging | WhatsApp, Slack | Real-time, delivery |
| Video | YouTube, Netflix | Storage, streaming |
| E-commerce | Amazon, Shopify | Inventory, payments |
| Transportation | Uber, DoorDash | Location, matching |

### Technical Concepts
- **Scalability** - Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- **Reliability** - Fault tolerance, redundancy
- **Performance** - Latency, throughput
- **Consistency** - CAP theorem trade-offs
- **Security** - Authentication, encryption
