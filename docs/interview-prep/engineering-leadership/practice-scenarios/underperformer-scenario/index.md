## Scenario Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (2-3 weeks)
1. **Gather Data**
   - Review performance metrics: code quality, velocity, bug rates
   - Collect 360-degree feedback from peers and stakeholders
   - Analyze historical performance trends and patterns

2. **Identify Patterns**
   - Is this a recent decline or ongoing issue?
   - Are problems technical, behavioral, or circumstantial?
   - How is this affecting team deliverables and morale?

3. **Environmental Analysis**
   - Are expectations clear and achievable?
   - Does the individual have necessary resources and support?
   - Are there organizational barriers to success?

### Phase 2: Direct Engagement (1-2 weeks)
1. **Schedule Private Meeting**
   - Choose neutral, comfortable setting
   - Prepare specific examples and data
   - Plan empathetic but direct conversation

2. **Conversation Framework**
   - "I've noticed some patterns in your recent work..."
   - "Help me understand what's happening..."
   - "What support do you need to succeed?"
   - "Let's work together on a path forward..."

3. **Listen and Assess**
   - Personal circumstances affecting performance
   - Skill gaps requiring additional training
   - Motivation and engagement levels
   - Career goals and interests alignment

### Phase 3: Improvement Plan (4-6 weeks)
1. **Create Specific Goals**
   - SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
   - Example: "Reduce P0 bugs by 75% over next 4 weeks"
   - Example: "Complete code reviews within 24 hours"

2. **Provide Resources**
   - Technical training or courses
   - Mentorship pairing with senior engineer
   - Regular 1:1 coaching sessions

3. **Establish Checkpoints**
   - Weekly progress reviews
   - Bi-weekly goal adjustment sessions
   - Monthly overall assessment

### Phase 4: Decision Point (1-2 weeks)
1. **Evaluate Progress**
   - Objective measurement against goals
   - Feedback from team members and stakeholders
   - Individual's engagement and commitment level

2. **Make Decision**
   - Continue with current plan (if improving)
   - Modify approach (if partially improving)
   - Initiate transition plan (if not improving)

3. **Communicate Outcome**
   - Clear, honest feedback about progress
   - Next steps and expectations
   - Support during any transitions

## Common Interview Examples

### Example 1: Technical Skills Gap

**Scenario**: "One of your senior engineers consistently delivers code with high bug rates and requires extensive rework. Their technical decisions are often questioned by the team, and they seem defensive about feedback. How do you handle this?"

**Strong Response Structure**:
1. **Assess objectively**: "I would first gather specific data on bug rates, rework frequency, and peer feedback to understand the scope and impact."

2. **Understand root cause**: "I'd schedule a private conversation to understand their perspective - are they overwhelmed, lacking certain skills, or dealing with external pressures?"

3. **Create improvement plan**: "Based on the assessment, I'd develop a plan that might include code review pairing, specific training on problem areas, and clear metrics for improvement."

4. **Monitor and support**: "I'd provide regular feedback, pair them with a mentor, and ensure they have the resources needed to succeed."

5. **Make difficult decisions**: "If improvement doesn't occur within the agreed timeline, I'd need to consider role adjustment or team transition while supporting both the individual and team."

### Example 2: Motivation and Engagement

**Scenario**: "A previously high-performing engineer has become disengaged. Their code quality remains acceptable, but they're no longer participating in design discussions, mentoring junior developers, or showing initiative. How do you re-engage them?"

**Strong Response Structure**:
1. **Investigate changes**: "I'd explore what changed - new project assignments, team dynamics, personal circumstances, or career dissatisfaction."

2. **Private conversation**: "I'd have an honest discussion about what I've observed and ask how they're feeling about their work and career direction."

3. **Address underlying issues**: "Based on their feedback, I might adjust their role, provide new challenges, address team issues, or discuss career development opportunities."

4. **Create engagement plan**: "I'd work with them to identify what would increase their engagement - different projects, leadership opportunities, or skill development."

5. **Follow through**: "Regular check-ins to ensure changes are having the desired effect and adjust as needed."

### Example 3: Cultural Fit Issues

**Scenario**: "A technically competent engineer consistently creates friction in team meetings, dismisses others' ideas, and works poorly in collaborative environments. How do you address this behavior while preserving their technical contributions?"

**Strong Response Structure**:
1. **Document specific behaviors**: "I'd gather concrete examples of disruptive behavior and its impact on team productivity and morale."

2. **Direct feedback**: "I'd have a clear conversation about the observed behaviors, their impact, and expectations for change."

3. **Skills development**: "I'd provide coaching or training on collaborative communication, emotional intelligence, or conflict resolution."

4. **Set clear boundaries**: "I'd establish specific behavioral expectations with measurable outcomes and regular progress reviews."

5. **Protect team culture**: "If behavioral changes don't occur, I'd need to consider role adjustments or team changes to preserve the team's collaborative culture."

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges
