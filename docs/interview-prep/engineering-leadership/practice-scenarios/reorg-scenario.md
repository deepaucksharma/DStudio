## 🔄 Scenario Setup

You've been managing a team of 12 engineers working on a core platform service. The company just announced a major reorganization:

- Your team will be split between two different product organizations
- You'll be managing a reduced team of 7 engineers
- 5 of your engineers will report to a different manager
- The platform will now serve two different product organizations with competing priorities
- Timeline: 6 weeks to complete the transition

Your team is anxious about the changes, worried about their careers, and concerned about the platform's future.

## 💭 Interview Question Framing

**Common ways this scenario appears in interviews:**

1. "Tell me about a time when you led your team through significant organizational change."
2. "How do you maintain team morale during uncertain times?"
3. "Describe a situation where you had to balance competing stakeholder priorities."
4. "How do you handle team anxiety about organizational changes?"

## 🎯 Answer Framework (STAR)

### Situation
- Platform team of 12 engineers serving multiple products
- Company reorg splitting team and changing reporting structure
- High team anxiety and uncertainty about future

### Task
- Ensure smooth transition with minimal disruption to platform stability
- Maintain team morale and productivity during change
- Set up both resulting teams for success
- Preserve critical platform knowledge

### Action

**Week 1-2: Transparency and Communication**
```
1. Immediate all-hands meeting:
   - Shared what I knew and what I didn't
   - Committed to regular updates
   - Created anonymous Q&A channel

2. Individual 1:1s with each engineer:
   - Understood personal concerns
   - Discussed career aspirations
   - Identified who wanted which team
```

**Week 3-4: Transition Planning**
```
1. Created transition plan:
   - Knowledge transfer matrix
   - Documentation sprints
   - Cross-training schedule

2. Worked with receiving manager:
   - Shared team member profiles
   - Joint meetings with transitioning engineers
   - Agreed on handoff timeline
```

**Week 5-6: Execution and Future State**
```
1. Implemented new structures:
   - Defined clear interfaces between teams
   - Set up shared on-call rotation initially
   - Created governance model for platform

2. Celebrated the past, embraced the future:
   - Team retrospective on achievements
   - "Graduation ceremony" for departing members
   - Vision setting for new team structure
```

### Result
- Zero attrition during transition (industry average: 15-20%)
- Platform maintained 99.9% uptime throughout
- Both teams shipping features within 2 weeks post-reorg
- Quarterly survey showed morale recovered to pre-reorg levels
- Established model used for 3 subsequent reorgs

## 🤔 Common Follow-up Questions

### Q: "How did you decide who stayed and who moved?"

**Strong answer elements:**
- Balanced individual preferences with business needs
- Considered skill distribution between teams
- Ensured both teams had senior technical leadership
- Made some hard decisions when preferences conflicted

### Q: "What was the hardest part of this transition?"

**Key points to cover:**
- Emotional toll of "losing" team members
- Balancing transparency with incomplete information
- Managing your own uncertainty while supporting others
- Maintaining platform stability during knowledge transfer

### Q: "How did you handle engineers who were unhappy with their placement?"

**Framework:**
1. Listened and validated concerns
2. Explored options within constraints
3. Created development plan for new team
4. Committed to revisit in 6 months
5. One case: facilitated internal transfer after stabilization

### Q: "What would you do differently?"

**Growth-oriented response:**
- Start documentation/knowledge transfer earlier
- Create more structured feedback loops
- Involve team more in transition planning
- Set up alumni channel for ongoing connection

## ✅ What Interviewers Look For

### 🟢 Green Flags
- **Empathy**: Prioritizing human impact alongside business needs
- **Communication**: Transparency and regular updates
- **Strategic thinking**: Planning beyond immediate transition
- **Resilience**: Maintaining performance during uncertainty
- **Leadership maturity**: Supporting team through personal disappointment

### Evaluation Criteria by Level

**Engineering Manager (L5-L6)**
- Focus on team morale and individual needs
- Tactical execution of transition
- Partnership with peer managers

**Senior Manager (L7)**
- Strategic platform decisions
- Cross-org stakeholder management
- Setting up sustainable structures

**Director+ (L8+)**
- Influence on reorg design
- Building organizational resilience
- Creating reusable frameworks

## 🚫 Red Flags to Avoid

### ❌ Never Say
- "I just followed orders from above"
- "I didn't agree with the reorg"
- "Some people just couldn't adapt"
- "I focused on keeping the best people"

### ⚠️ Avoid These Behaviors
- **Blaming leadership**: Even if reorg was poorly planned
- **Playing favorites**: Appearing to privilege certain team members
- **Information hoarding**: Using knowledge as power
- **Minimizing impact**: "It wasn't that big a deal"

## 📊 Level-Specific Variations

### New Engineering Manager (L5)
**Emphasis**: Personal leadership and team support
```
"I scheduled daily standup 'pulse checks' for the first two weeks,
where we spent 5 minutes on feelings before diving into work.
This helped surface concerns early and showed the team I cared
about their wellbeing, not just deliverables."
```

### Senior Engineering Manager (L7)
**Emphasis**: Systems and processes
```
"I designed a 'Platform Charter' defining interfaces, ownership,
and escalation paths between the split teams. This became the
template for 6 other platform teams going through similar splits,
reducing cross-team friction by 40% post-reorg."
```

### Director (L8+)
**Emphasis**: Organizational design and influence
```
"I influenced the reorg design by proposing a 'platform guild'
structure that maintained technical cohesion despite reporting
separation. This model was adopted company-wide, reducing platform
fragmentation issues that plagued previous reorgs. I also established
quarterly platform reviews with both VPs to ensure aligned priorities."
```
