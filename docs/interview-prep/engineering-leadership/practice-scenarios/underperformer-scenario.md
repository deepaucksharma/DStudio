# Managing Underperformers - Practice Scenario

## Scenario Overview

You have a senior engineer (L5/E5) on your team who was previously a high performer but has been underperforming for the past 3 months. Their code quality has declined, they're missing deadlines, and other team members are starting to complain. This engineer has been with the company for 4 years and has critical knowledge of legacy systems.

## Key Information
- **Your Role**: Engineering Manager with 15 direct reports
- **Engineer Profile**: 
  - Name: Alex
  - Tenure: 4 years
  - Previous rating: Exceeds Expectations
  - Current performance: Below Expectations
  - Critical knowledge: Payment processing system
- **Timeline**: Q4 (performance reviews in 6 weeks)
- **Context**: Company recently went through layoffs

## Interview Questions You Might Face

### 1. Initial Approach
**Question**: "How would you first address this situation with Alex?"

**Strong Answer Framework**:
```
1. Private 1:1 meeting within 48 hours
2. Lead with curiosity, not judgment
3. Acknowledge previous strong performance
4. Ask open-ended questions:
   - "I've noticed some changes in your work recently. How are you feeling about things?"
   - "Is there anything going on that I should know about?"
   - "How can I better support you?"
5. Listen actively and take notes
```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
**Question**: "What might be causing this performance change?"

**Potential Causes to Explore**:
- **Personal**: Health, family, financial stress
- **Professional**: Burnout, lack of growth, post-layoff anxiety
- **Team**: Conflicts, changing dynamics
- **Technical**: Skill gaps, unclear requirements
- **Organizational**: Role clarity, competing priorities

### 3. Performance Improvement Plan
**Question**: "Walk me through creating a PIP for this engineer."

**Comprehensive PIP Structure**:

#### Week 1-2: Discovery and Alignment
- Document current performance gaps
- Set clear, measurable goals
- Agree on check-in cadence (weekly)
- Identify support resources

#### 30-Day Goals
- Code Quality: 0 critical bugs in PR reviews
- Delivery: Complete 2 medium-complexity tasks
- Communication: Daily standups, weekly 1:1s
- Collaboration: Pair program 2x/week

#### 60-Day Goals  
- Lead one feature end-to-end
- Mentor junior engineer
- Document one legacy system
- Receive "Meets" on all competencies

#### 90-Day Goals
- Return to full productivity
- Positive peer feedback
- Clear growth trajectory

### 4. Balancing Team Impact
**Question**: "How do you manage the team's concerns while supporting Alex?"

**Leadership Approach**:
1. **Protect Privacy**: Never discuss Alex's situation
2. **Redistribute Work**: Temporarily rebalance without overloading others
3. **Address Concerns**: "I'm aware of the situation and actively addressing it"
4. **Monitor Morale**: Weekly team health checks
5. **Celebrate Wins**: Highlight when Alex improves

### 5. Difficult Decisions
**Question**: "What if Alex doesn't improve after the PIP?"

**Decision Framework**:
```
1. Evaluate Progress
   - Met 0-50% of goals → Transition planning
   - Met 50-80% of goals → Extend with modifications
   - Met 80%+ of goals → Continue support

2. Transition Planning (if needed)
   - 4-week knowledge transfer
   - Document critical systems
   - Pair with team members
   - Respectful exit

3. Team Communication
   - "Alex has decided to pursue opportunities outside the company"
   - Focus on smooth transition
   - Acknowledge contributions
```

## Advanced Considerations

### Legal and HR Aspects
- Document everything in writing
- Include HR from day 1
- Follow company PIP process
- Consider protected class implications
- Maintain confidentiality

### Knowledge Transfer Risk
- Start documentation immediately
- Assign backup for critical systems
- Create runbooks
- Record architecture decisions
- Pair programming for knowledge sharing

### Team Dynamics
- Prevent resentment buildup
- Maintain fairness perception
- Continue team building
- Address survivor syndrome
- Celebrate team resilience

## Role-Play Practice

### Interviewer Challenge Questions

**Q**: "What if Alex says they're dealing with depression?"
**A**: "I'd express empathy, suggest EAP resources, work with HR on accommodations, and adjust the PIP timeline while maintaining performance standards."

**Q**: "How do you handle if other team members threaten to leave?"
**A**: "I'd have individual conversations to understand concerns, share what I can about addressing the situation, and ensure they feel valued while maintaining Alex's privacy."

**Q**: "What if Alex has critical knowledge no one else has?"
**A**: "I'd immediately start risk mitigation: assign a backup, begin documentation, schedule knowledge transfer sessions, and consider extending timeline if progress is shown."
