# Team Conflict Resolution - Practice Scenario

## Scenario Overview

Two of your senior engineers (both L5/E5) are in an escalating conflict that's affecting team morale. Sarah (frontend lead) and Mike (backend lead) fundamentally disagree on the API design for a critical customer-facing feature. Their conflict has become public in team meetings, PRs are getting contentious, and other engineers are starting to take sides.

## Context and Complexity

### The Players
- **Sarah**: 3 years tenure, frontend tech lead, influential with junior engineers
- **Mike**: 5 years tenure, backend tech lead, owns critical services
- **You**: EM with 12 reports, including Sarah and Mike
- **Your Manager**: Director expecting feature delivery in 6 weeks
- **PM**: Frustrated with delays, escalating to leadership

### The Technical Dispute
- Sarah wants RESTful APIs with GraphQL for flexibility
- Mike insists on gRPC for performance and type safety
- Both have valid technical arguments
- Previous compromise attempts have failed

### The Human Element  
- Public disagreement in sprint planning
- Passive-aggressive PR comments
- Junior engineers afraid to contribute
- Team velocity dropped 30%
- Two engineers requested team transfers

## Interview Deep Dive Questions

### 1. Immediate Response
**Question**: "You just witnessed a heated argument between Sarah and Mike in sprint planning. What do you do in the moment?"

**Strong Response Framework**:
```
Immediate (Same Day):
1. Pause the meeting professionally
   "Let's take a 10-minute break. Sarah and Mike, please stay back."

2. De-escalate privately
   "I can see you both care deeply about this. Let's find a path forward."

3. Set boundaries
   "Technical debates are healthy, but we need to maintain respect."

4. Schedule follow-ups
   - Individual 1:1s with each (same day)
   - Joint problem-solving session (next day)
   - Team address (within 48 hours)
```

**What Not to Do**:
- ❌ Ignore it hoping it resolves itself
- ❌ Take sides publicly
- ❌ Discipline them in front of team
- ❌ Make technical decision immediately

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
**Question**: "How do you understand what's really driving this conflict?"

**Investigation Approach**:

#### Individual 1:1s (Psychological Safety)
```
Questions to ask:
- "Help me understand your perspective on this situation"
- "What's really at stake for you here?"
- "How is this affecting your work satisfaction?"
- "What would a good outcome look like?"

Listen for:
- Technical concerns vs. ego/control issues
- Past conflicts or resentments
- Career/promotion anxieties
- Different working styles
```

#### Pattern Recognition
Common root causes:
1. **Technical Philosophy**: Different backgrounds (startup vs enterprise)
2. **Career Competition**: Both aiming for staff promotion
3. **Communication Styles**: Direct vs diplomatic
4. **Past History**: Previous conflicts unresolved
5. **Organizational Issues**: Unclear ownership/boundaries

### 3. Resolution Strategy
**Question**: "Walk me through your plan to resolve this conflict."

**Multi-Pronged Approach**:

#### Week 1: Stabilize
```
Day 1-2: Individual coaching
- Acknowledge their expertise
- Set behavioral expectations
- Find common ground (both want product success)

Day 3: Facilitated technical discussion
- Neutral facilitator (principal engineer)
- Focus on customer requirements
- Document pros/cons objectively
- Time-boxed decision process

Day 4-5: Team healing
- Address team openly (without blame)
- Reinforce team values
- Show path forward
```

#### Week 2-3: Rebuild
```
Technical Resolution:
- Spike both approaches (1 week)
- Data-driven comparison
- Include wider team input
- Make decision transparent

Relationship Repair:
- Paired work on non-contentious task
- Public acknowledgment of each other's strengths
- Regular check-ins on dynamics
```

#### Week 4+: Prevent Recurrence
```
Systemic Changes:
- Clear API design process/guidelines
- Defined escalation path
- Regular architecture reviews
- Team working agreements
```

### 4. Stakeholder Management
**Question**: "How do you manage up and across while dealing with this?"

**Communication Plan**:

#### To Your Manager (Director)
```
Initial Update (Day 1):
"I'm aware of the technical disagreement between Sarah and Mike. 
I have a plan to resolve this within a week while keeping 
delivery on track. I'll update you by Friday."

Weekly Updates:
- Situation summary
- Actions taken
- Risk mitigation
- Support needed
```

#### To PM/Product
```
"I understand your frustration with the delays. We're resolving
a technical decision that will actually save us time long-term.
I'm confident we'll still hit the 6-week deadline with a better
solution."
```

#### To Team
```
"I know the recent tensions have been difficult. We're working
through this as a team. Your psychological safety is my priority.
Please come to me with any concerns."
```

### 5. Long-term Prevention
**Question**: "How do you prevent this from happening again?"

**Systemic Improvements**:

1. **Technical Decision Framework**
   ```
   - RFC process for major decisions
   - Clear RACI for architecture choices
   - Time-boxed debate periods
   - Escalation to principal engineers
   ```

2. **Team Culture Building**
   ```
   - Monthly team retrospectives
   - Conflict resolution training
   - Celebrating healthy disagreements
   - Team bonding activities
   ```

3. **Career Development**
   ```
   - Clear growth paths for both
   - Reduce zero-sum competition
   - Complementary responsibilities
   - Mentorship opportunities
   ```

## Advanced Scenarios

### Escalation: "What if one demands the other be moved?"

**Response Strategy**:
1. Don't make immediate promises
2. Explore underlying concerns
3. Consider temporary project separation
4. Set clear expectations for professional behavior
5. Document everything with HR

### Complication: "Mike threatens to leave the company"

**Balancing Act**:
- Don't give in to ultimatums
- Acknowledge his value
- Explore what would make him stay
- Prepare succession planning
- Maintain team stability

### Plot Twist: "You discover Mike has been interviewing"

**Leadership Approach**:
- Address directly but privately
- Understand his motivations
- Don't use against him in conflict
- Accelerate resolution timeline
- Start knowledge transfer planning
