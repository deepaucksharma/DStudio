# Practice Scenario: Delivering Bad News

## üì∞ Scenario Setup

You're the Engineering Manager for a team that's been working on a major product initiative for 8 months. The project involves:

- Revolutionary AI-powered feature set
- 15 engineers fully dedicated
- $3M invested so far
- Company's "big bet" for the next fiscal year
- Team morale at all-time high

Two days ago, the CEO called an emergency meeting. Due to market conditions and a major competitor's release, the company is pivoting strategy. Your project is being cancelled immediately, and worse - 30% workforce reduction is required, affecting 5 people from your team.

## üí≠ Interview Question Framing

**Common ways this scenario appears in interviews:**

1. "Tell me about a time you had to deliver devastating news to your team."
2. "How do you handle project cancellations after significant investment?"
3. "Describe a situation where you had to conduct layoffs."
4. "How do you maintain team trust when delivering bad news from leadership?"

## üéØ Answer Framework (STAR)

### Situation
- 8-month AI initiative cancelled due to market pivot
- $3M sunk cost, 15 engineers affected
- Layoffs required: 5 team members (33% reduction)
- 48 hours to plan and execute communication

### Task
- Deliver news with dignity and transparency
- Support affected employees through transition
- Maintain remaining team's morale and productivity
- Preserve team's trust in leadership (including myself)

### Action

**Day 1: Planning and Preparation**
```
1. Processed my own emotions first:
   - Took 2-hour walk to manage initial anger/disappointment
   - Called mentor for perspective
   - Shifted mindset from "victim" to "leader"

2. Influenced the process:
   - Negotiated enhanced severance (3‚Üí4 months)
   - Secured extension for visa-dependent employees
   - Got commitment for reference letters and job placement help
```

**Day 2: Individual Notifications (Laid-off Employees)**
```
Morning: Met with each affected person individually
- Delivered news directly and compassionately
- Explained it was business decision, not performance
- Detailed severance, benefits continuation, support
- Offered to be reference and make introductions
- Gave them rest of day off, optional return tomorrow
```

**Day 2: Team Communication**
```
Afternoon: All-hands with remaining team
1. Shared the complete context:
   - Market conditions that drove decision
   - Why our project specifically was cut
   - Acknowledged the unfairness and pain

2. Addressed survivor guilt directly:
   - "You're not here because you're 'better'"
   - "Business decisions aren't personal judgments"
   - Created space for emotions

3. Set expectations:
   - Cancel all meetings for next 2 days
   - Open office hours for anyone needing to talk
   - No deliverables expected this week
```

**Week 1-2: Recovery and Rebuilding**
```
1. Supporting departing teammates:
   - Daily check-ins during notice period
   - LinkedIn recommendations for all
   - Introduced 3 people to hiring managers
   - Team-funded farewell celebration

2. Rebuilding remaining team:
   - 1:1s focused on emotional processing
   - Collaborative session on "what's next"
   - Gradual ramp back to normal velocity
```

### Result
- 4 of 5 laid-off engineers found new roles within 6 weeks
- 5th person used severance to bootstrap startup (now successful!)
- Zero additional attrition in following 6 months
- Team morale recovered to 85% baseline within quarter
- Team delivered critical infrastructure project 2 months later
- Maintained relationships with all laid-off employees

## ü§î Common Follow-up Questions

### Q: "How did you decide who to lay off?"

**Strong answer framework:**
1. **Criteria development**:
   - Business needs for go-forward projects
   - Skill redundancy vs. unique capabilities
   - Visa/life situation considerations
   - Performance as last factor, not first

2. **Process transparency**:
   - Involved HR and skip-level for fairness
   - Documented rationale for each decision
   - Ensured legal compliance

### Q: "What was the hardest conversation?"

**Specific example:**
```
"The hardest was with Sarah, a visa-dependent engineer with 18 months
left. She broke down, fearing deportation. I immediately called HR
to confirm her 60-day grace period, helped her understand options,
and connected her with an immigration attorney. I also reached out
to three companies I knew were hiring and sponsoring. She landed
a role at one within 3 weeks."
```

### Q: "How did you handle your own emotions?"

**Vulnerability with strength:**
1. Acknowledged the personal impact
2. Described healthy coping mechanisms
3. Emphasized not burdening team with my emotions
4. Showed how processing helped me lead better

### Q: "Did you disagree with the decision?"

**Diplomatic but honest:**
```
"I understood the business rationale, though I believed we could have
pivoted the project rather than cancel it. I shared this perspective
with leadership, presenting three pivot options. While they ultimately
proceeded with cancellation, they appreciated the input and used one
idea for the remaining team's new charter."
```

## ‚úÖ What Interviewers Look For

### üü¢ Green Flags

**Emotional Intelligence**
- Processing own emotions before leading others
- Reading room and adapting approach
- Creating safe spaces for team feelings

**Practical Leadership**
- Concrete support actions (not just words)
- Fighting for team's interests within constraints
- Balancing empathy with business reality

**Communication Excellence**
- Direct, clear messaging without corporate speak
- Appropriate transparency about context
- Follow-through on commitments

**Values in Action**
- Treating departing employees with dignity
- Taking personal responsibility as leader
- Long-term relationship thinking

### Evaluation Criteria by Level

**Engineering Manager (L5-L6)**

- Clear, compassionate communication
- Team morale recovery

**Senior Manager (L7)**
- Influencing severance/support terms
- Managing stakeholder communications
- Building resilient team culture

**Director+ (L8+)**

- Creating organizational learning
- Industry network activation

## üö´ Red Flags to Avoid

### ‚ùå Never Say
- "I was just the messenger"
- "They weren't that strong anyway"
- "At least you still have a job"
- "This hurt me more than you"
- "I tried to save everyone but couldn't"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problematic Patterns
- **Over-promising**: Making commitments you can't keep
- **False optimism**: "Everything happens for a reason"
- **Blame shifting**: Throwing leadership under bus
- **Emotional dumping**: Making it about your pain
- **Favoritism**: Implying you "saved" certain people

## üìä Level-Specific Variations

### New Engineering Manager (L5)
**Emphasis**: Individual support and team care
```
"I scheduled 90-minute 1:1s with each remaining team member in 
the first week. We spent half the time processing the layoffs
and half exploring what motivated them in our new direction.
This investment in emotional recovery paid off - we delivered
our first new feature in just 3 weeks."
```

### Senior Engineering Manager (L7)
**Emphasis**: Organizational influence and systemic improvements
```
"I partnered with HR to create a 'Project Sunset Playbook' based
on our experience. It included communication templates, support
checklists, and timeline recommendations. This became the company
standard, improving how we handled three subsequent project cancellations."
```

### Director (L8+)
**Emphasis**: Strategic workforce decisions and industry leadership
```
"I influenced the reduction strategy to preserve critical AI expertise,
proposing a shared services model that saved 3 positions. I also
activated my network to place affected engineers, personally calling
12 CTOs. This led to creating an industry-wide 'talent safety net'
program for ethical layoffs, now used by 20+ companies."
```
