# Team Topologies

> **Note**: This section is under construction.

## Overview

Team topologies represent a systematic approach to organizational design that optimizes team structures, communication patterns, and cognitive load distribution to enable effective software delivery and organizational scalability. This framework, based on Conway's Law and systems thinking, addresses stream-aligned teams, enabling teams, complicated subsystem teams, and platform teams to create sustainable engineering organizations.

## Topics to be Covered

- **Core concepts and principles** - Four fundamental team types, Conway's Law implications, and cognitive load theory applications
- **Best practices and frameworks** - Proven methodologies for team topology assessment, organizational restructuring, and team interaction patterns
- **Real-world examples** - Case studies from successful engineering organizations implementing team topologies for improved delivery and scalability
- **Implementation guides** - Practical approaches for organizational transformation, team boundary definition, and sustainable topology maintenance

## Coming Soon

Check back soon for detailed content on this topic.

## Prerequisites

To understand and implement team topologies effectively, leaders should have experience with software delivery organizations, knowledge of systems thinking and Conway's Law, familiarity with DevOps practices and platform engineering concepts, and understanding of organizational design principles. Previous exposure to agile methodologies and team dynamics will enhance comprehension.


## Steps

Implementing team topologies involves comprehensive organizational assessment and current topology mapping, cognitive load analysis and team capability evaluation, target topology design based on business and technical constraints, gradual organizational restructuring and team formation, communication pattern establishment, and continuous topology optimization based on delivery outcomes and team effectiveness.
