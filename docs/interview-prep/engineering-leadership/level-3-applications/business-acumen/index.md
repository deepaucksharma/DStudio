## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Budget Reduction
```
Context: 20% budget cut required across engineering
Challenge: Maintain productivity while reducing costs
Approach: Data-driven optimization of tools, vendors, and priorities
```

### Scenario 2: Build vs Buy Decision
```
Context: Core platform component needs replacement
Challenge: Justify engineering investment vs vendor solution
Approach: Total cost of ownership analysis with risk assessment
```

### Scenario 3: Executive Presentation
```
Context: Quarterly board update on engineering progress
Challenge: Translate technical achievements to business impact
Approach: Focus on customer value and financial outcomes
```

## Interview Question Patterns

### Business Strategy Questions
