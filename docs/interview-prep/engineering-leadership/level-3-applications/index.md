## Domain Integration Matrix

| Domain | Core Focus | Key Competencies | Interview Weight |
|--------|------------|------------------|------------------|
| **People Management** | Team Excellence | Hiring, Performance, Development, Culture | 30-40% |
| **Technical Leadership** | Technical Excellence | Architecture, Strategy, Innovation, Standards | 25-35% |
| **Organizational Design** | Structural Excellence | Scaling, Process, Communication, Change | 20-30% |
| **Business Acumen** | Business Alignment | Metrics, Stakeholders, Resources, Strategy | 15-25% |

## How to Use This Level

### 1. Self-Assessment
- Evaluate your current expertise in each domain
- Identify gaps and prioritize development areas
- Use domain-specific rubrics for objective assessment

### 2. Scenario Practice
- Work through real-world scenarios in each domain
- Practice cross-domain problem solving
- Build pattern recognition for common challenges

### 3. Interview Preparation
- Map job requirements to specific domains
- Prepare STAR stories for each competency area
- Practice domain-specific question types

## Cross-Domain Integration

Real engineering leadership requires seamless integration across all four domains:

   - Deep technical expertise
   - Mentoring individuals
   - Project leadership

2. **Expansion** (TL → EM)
   - Team management
   - Process development
   - Cross-team collaboration

3. **Scale** (EM → Director)
   - Multi-team leadership
   - Organizational design
   - Strategic planning

4. **Impact** (Director → VP)
   - Company-wide influence
   - Executive partnership
   - Culture transformation

## Foundation in First Principles

Each application domain is grounded in [Level I: First Principles](../level-1-first-principles/):

- **People Management** centers on [Human Behavior](../level-1-first-principles/human-behavior/)
- **Technical Leadership** maximizes [Value Creation](../level-1-first-principles/value-creation/)
- **Organizational Design** applies [Systems Thinking](../level-1-first-principles/systems-thinking/)
- **Business Acumen** integrates all principles for impact

## Powered by Business Concepts

Applications leverage [Level II: Core Business Concepts](../level-2-core-business/):

- **[Leadership](../level-2-core-business/leadership/)** frameworks guide people management
- **[Strategy](../level-2-core-business/strategy/)** informs technical direction
- **[Operations](../level-2-core-business/operations/)** enables organizational scale
- **[Finance](../level-2-core-business/finance/)** drives business acumen
