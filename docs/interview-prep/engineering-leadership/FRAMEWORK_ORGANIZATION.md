# Engineering Leadership Interview Framework Organization

## Overview

The engineering leadership interview preparation content is organized using a principled 4-level framework that builds from foundational truths to practical execution. This document explains the organization for maintainers and contributors.

## The Four-Level Architecture

### Level I: First Principles (The Foundational "Why")
**Location**: `level-1-first-principles/`

Universal truths that justify every leadership action:
1. **Value Creation** - Business exists to solve problems profitably
2. **Decision-Making** - Progress requires timely choices under uncertainty
3. **Human Behavior** - Culture and motivation determine execution quality
4. **Systems Thinking** - Organizations are interdependent, feedback-rich systems
5. **Integrity & Ethics** - Trust is the ultimate competitive advantage

### Level II: Core Business Concepts (The Strategic "How")
**Location**: `level-2-core-business/`

MBA-level disciplines for creating competitive advantage:
1. **Strategy** - Creating and capturing sustainable value
2. **Leadership** - Mobilizing humans toward shared goals
3. **Operations** - Building the engine of execution
4. **Finance** - Understanding and creating economic value
5. **Risk & Governance** - Managing uncertainty and accountability

### Level III: Engineering Applications (The Practical "What")
**Location**: `level-3-applications/`

Day-to-day domains where leaders apply principles:
1. **People Management** - Hiring, developing, and retaining talent
2. **Technical Leadership** - Architecture, innovation, and technical strategy
3. **Organizational Design** - Scaling teams and systems
4. **Business Acumen** - Metrics, stakeholders, and cross-functional work

### Level IV: Interview Execution (The "Proof")
**Location**: `level-4-interview-execution/`

Demonstrating mastery under interview pressure:
1. **Interview Types** - Behavioral, technical, system design, culture
2. **Execution Tools** - STAR+, story portfolio, principle hooks
3. **Interactive Practice** - Timers, assessments, question banks

## Cross-References

The framework is designed as an interconnected knowledge graph:
- Each principle links to related concepts and applications
- Business concepts show which principles they operationalize
- Applications reference foundational principles and concepts
- Interview execution connects to all levels

## Navigation Structure

The content appears in mkdocs.yml under:
```

## Maintenance Notes

1. **Adding Content**: Place new content in the appropriate level based on its nature (principle, concept, application, or execution)
2. **Cross-Linking**: Always add bidirectional links when creating relationships
3. **Navigation**: Update mkdocs.yml when adding new pages
4. **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns for page structure and formatting

## Design Philosophy

- **Depth over Breadth**: Each topic goes deep rather than superficial coverage
- **Practical Focus**: Theory always connects to engineering leadership practice
- **Interview Ready**: Everything builds toward interview success
- **Multiple Paths**: Users can start anywhere based on their needs
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity increases through the levels

This framework integrates elite business school principles with engineering leadership practice, creating a comprehensive guide for leadership interviews at any level.
