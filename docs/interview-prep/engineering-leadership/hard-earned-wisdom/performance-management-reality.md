## The Ugly Truth About Performance

HR will tell you performance management is about "growth and development." The reality? It's about protecting the company from lawsuits while getting rid of people who don't work out. Here's how to navigate this minefield while still being a human being.

## üîÑ Framework Integration: Where Theory Meets Reality

### How Performance Management Challenges Core Principles

#### Human Behavior Reality
```
Theory: "People are motivated by growth and development"
Reality: People are motivated by survival and status

Consequences:
- PIPs trigger fight-or-flight, not growth mindset
- Stack ranking creates zero-sum competition
- "Development" becomes code for "manage out"
```

#### Value Creation Paradox
```
Theory: "Invest in people to create value"
Reality: Sometimes removing people creates more value

The Calculation:
- Cost of keeping bad performer: Team morale, attrition, productivity
- Cost of removing: Severance, replacement, knowledge loss
- Hidden cost: Reputation as "hire and fire" shop
```

#### Operations vs. Leadership Tension
```
Operations Mindset: "Fix the system, not the person"
Leadership Reality: "Sometimes the person IS the system problem"

When They Collide:
- Process improvements can't fix attitude problems
- Cultural issues masquerade as performance issues
- Systems compensate for weak performers (technical debt)
```

## üö® When Principles Collide: The Impossible Choices

### Fairness vs. Business Needs

**The Dilemma**: Your ethics say treat everyone fairly. Business says cut the bottom 10%.

**Real Scenario**:
```
You have two engineers:
- Amy: Solid performer, single mom, been here 5 years
- Brad: Slightly better performer, no dependents, been here 2 years

Budget cuts demand one goes. What's "fair"?
- Performance lens: Keep Brad
- Loyalty lens: Keep Amy
- Dependency lens: Keep Amy
- Legal lens: Document everything
- Human lens: This sucks no matter what
```

**The Framework**:
1. **Acknowledge the conflict** - Don't pretend there's a "right" answer
2. **Document your criteria** - Be consistent across decisions
3. **Consider second-order effects** - Team morale, survivor guilt
4. **Own the decision** - Don't blame "the company"
5. **Support both outcomes** - Help whoever goes, support whoever stays

### Transparency vs. Confidentiality

**The Dilemma**: Team wants to know why someone left. You can't tell them.

**The Scripts That Don't Work**:
- "They pursued other opportunities" (Team: "BS, what really happened?")
- "I can't discuss it" (Team: "So they were fired, got it")
- "They weren't a good fit" (Team: "Am I next?")

**The Sophisticated Approach**:
```
"I understand you want clarity. Here's what I can share:
- The decision was thoughtful and necessary
- It doesn't reflect on any of you
- If you have concerns about your own performance, let's talk
- The work will be redistributed as follows..."

Then redirect to the future, not the past.
```

## üé≠ The Performance Theater

### The Annual Review Charade

**What HR Says**: "Reviews help employees grow and develop"

**The Reality**: 
- Ratings were decided in calibration before you wrote anything
- Your carefully crafted feedback will be watered down by legal
- The employee already knows their rating from their bonus
- 360 feedback is 50% politics, 30% revenge, 20% useful

**How to Make It Less Terrible**:
```
1. Give real feedback throughout the year (reviews should be no surprises)
2. Write the review YOUR way first, then translate to HR-speak
3. Have the real conversation in person, not in the tool
4. Focus on specific examples, not generic competencies
5. If they're getting PIP'd, they should already know
```

## üíÄ The PIP Reality: Performance Improvement or Pathway to Exit?

### The Truth About PIPs

**Success Rate**: 
- Industry claim: "PIPs help employees improve"
- Reality: 85% of PIPs end in termination
- The 15% who survive usually leave within 6 months anyway

### The Complex Scenarios Nobody Talks About

#### Managing Out a Co-Founder

**The Situation**: Technical co-founder who can't scale, board wants them out.

**The Minefield**:
- Massive equity stake
- Emotional attachment
- Tribal knowledge
- Founder dynamics
- Public perception

**The Playbook**:
```python
def manage_out_cofounder():
    # Phase 1: Align the Board
    board_consensus = build_unanimous_agreement()
    transition_plan = design_graceful_exit()
    equity_solution = negotiate_vesting_acceleration()
    
    # Phase 2: The Conversation
    approach = {
        'setting': 'Off-site, not office',
        'participants': 'CEO + trusted board member',
        'frame': 'Evolution, not failure',
        'offer': 'Advisor role + equity preservation'
    }
    
    # Phase 3: The Transition
    announcement = 'Moving to strategic advisor role'
    knowledge_transfer = '3-month overlap period'
    narrative_control = 'United front, positive spin'
    
    # Phase 4: The Aftermath
    team_messaging = 'Evolution of company needs'
    culture_preservation = 'Honor the history'
    successor_onboarding = 'Respect the legacy'
```

**Real Example**:
"CTO co-founder built amazing MVP, couldn't manage beyond 50 people. Took 6 months of coaching, board alignment, and negotiation. Ended with advisory role, accelerated vesting, and positive announcement. Team actually relieved. He's happier too."

#### The Protected Class Termination

**The Reality**: Sometimes you need to fire someone who's a member of a protected class.

**The Extra Careful Playbook**:
```
1. Document 2x more than normal
2. Apply identical standards across team
3. Show attempts at accommodation
4. Get second-level review
5. Have HR/Legal deeply involved
6. Consider larger severance
7. Prepare for claims regardless
```

**The Triple-Check Framework**:
- **Performance**: Is it clearly substandard?
- **Process**: Did we follow it exactly?
- **Pattern**: Are we consistent with others?
- **Paper**: Is everything documented?
- **Perception**: How will this look externally?

#### The High Performer Having a Breakdown

**The Situation**: Star performer suddenly struggling - divorce, death, mental health.

**The Human Approach**:
```
Phase 1: Recognition
- Notice pattern changes
- Private, compassionate check-in
- Offer resources (EAP, time off)

Phase 2: Accommodation
- Temporary reduced responsibilities
- Flexible work arrangements
- Regular check-ins
- Clear but adjusted expectations

Phase 3: Decision Point (3-6 months)
- Honest assessment
- Three paths:
  1. Full recovery ‚Üí return to role
  2. Partial recovery ‚Üí modified role
  3. No recovery ‚Üí compassionate exit
```

**The Balance**:
- Too much accommodation: Team resentment
- Too little: Lose good person in bad moment
- Just right: Temporary support with clear boundaries

### The Three Types of PIPs

#### 1. The Legal CYA PIP
- **Purpose**: Document before firing to avoid lawsuits
- **Duration**: 30-60 days
- **Success Criteria**: Impossible to meet
- **Your Role**: Execute professionally, protect team, help them land softly

**Example Language**:
```
"Deliver Project X (3-month project) in 30 days with zero defects"
"Improve team morale scores by 40% in 4 weeks"
"Resolve all 47 technical debt tickets while maintaining feature velocity"
```

#### 2. The Wake-Up Call PIP
- **Purpose**: Shock high performer who's coasting
- **Duration**: 60-90 days
- **Success Criteria**: Challenging but achievable
- **Your Role**: Coach intensively, really want them to succeed

**Real Example**:
"Sarah was brilliant but had checked out after promotion rejection. PIP focused on specific deliverables. Daily check-ins, clear milestones. She turned it around, got promoted 8 months later. Rare but possible."

#### 3. The Political PIP
- **Purpose**: Someone powerful wants them gone
- **Duration**: Variable
- **Success Criteria**: Moving goalposts
- **Your Role**: Protect yourself, document everything, help them exit gracefully

### The PIP Playbook

#### Week -4: Pre-PIP Preparation
```python
def prepare_for_pip():
    # Document everything
    performance_issues = collect_specific_examples()
    impact_on_team = quantify_negative_effects()
    attempted_interventions = list_all_coaching_attempts()
    
    # Cover your ass
    hr_alignment = meet_with_hr_partner()
    legal_review = get_template_approved()
    peer_calibration = verify_consistent_standards()
    
    # Prepare the human
    start_regular_1_1s = increase_frequency()
    give_clear_warnings = "This is serious, job at risk"
    suggest_job_search = "Might want to explore options"
```

#### Week 0: PIP Delivery

**The Conversation Script**:
```
"I need to share something difficult. Your performance hasn't met expectations 
in [specific areas]. We're putting you on a formal Performance Improvement Plan.

This is serious - your job is at risk if things don't improve. The PIP lasts 
[duration] and has specific goals [review document].

I want you to succeed, but I need to be honest - most PIPs don't work out. 
I recommend you:
1. Give this your absolute best effort
2. Start networking, just in case
3. Let me know how I can support you

Do you need time to process? We can reconvene tomorrow to discuss details."
```

#### During PIP: The Delicate Balance

**What You Must Do**:
- Document every interaction (BCC yourself)
- Meet at agreed frequency (no canceling)
- Give honest feedback (no false hope)
- Protect the team (redistribute work quietly)
- Maintain dignity (they're still human)

**What You Must Not Do**:
- Promise outcomes you can't control
- Share PIP status with team
- Treat them like they're already gone
- Skip any process steps
- Let emotion override judgment

#### PIP Outcomes

**Success Path** (15% chance):
```
Week 2: Noticeable effort increase
Week 4: Meeting some objectives
Week 6: Consistent improvement
Week 8: Cautious optimism
Final: Remove from PIP, watch closely
```

**Failure Path** (85% chance):
```
Week 2: Denial or panic
Week 4: Missing objectives
Week 6: Looking for new job
Week 8: Checked out
Final: Termination meeting
```

## üí∏ The Hidden Costs: What Nobody Calculates

### The Survivor Guilt Syndrome

**What Happens After Layoffs**:
```
Week 1: Relief ("I survived")
Week 2: Guilt ("Why them not me?")
Week 3: Fear ("Am I next?")
Week 4: Overwork ("Prove my worth")
Month 2: Burnout ("Can't sustain this")
Month 3: Attrition ("I'm out")
```

**The True Cost Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_real_termination_cost(employee):
    visible_costs = {
        'severance': salary * severance_weeks,
        'cobra': benefits_cost * 3,
        'legal': potential_claim_cost,
        'recruiting': replacement_cost
    }
    
    hidden_costs = {
        'team_productivity': -20% for 3 months,
        'survivor_attrition': 1.5 additional departures,
        'management_time': 40 hours of damage control,
        'knowledge_loss': 6 months of context,
        'culture_damage': immeasurable
    }
    
    return visible_costs + hidden_costs  # Usually 3-5x salary
```

### Team Morale Trajectory

**The Toxic Performer Removal**:
```
Before: Team walks on eggshells
Day 1: Shock and uncertainty
Week 1: Cautious optimism
Week 2: "Holy shit, it's better"
Month 1: 30% productivity boost
Month 3: "Why didn't we do this sooner?"
```

**The Good Person/Bad Fit Removal**:
```
Before: Everyone likes them but frustrated
Day 1: Genuine sadness
Week 1: Questioning decision
Week 2: Work gets easier
Month 1: Miss person, don't miss problem
Month 3: New normal established
```

## üó°Ô∏è Managing Out: The Other Dark Arts

### üéì Level-Specific Wisdom: What You Learn When

#### Senior Manager Level
**What You Think**: "I can coach anyone to success"
**What You Learn**: "Some people don't want to be coached"

**Key Realizations**:
- Not every performance issue is fixable
- Protecting the team > saving the individual
- Document from day one, not when problems start
- Your gut feeling is usually right

**New Skills**:
- Writing legally defensible documentation
- Having "the talk" compassionately
- Managing survivor reactions
- Playing calibration politics

#### Director Level
**What You Think**: "It's about building systems"
**What You Learn**: "It's about organizational design"

**Key Realizations**:
- Performance problems often = role misalignment
- Reorgs can solve what PIPs cannot
- Political capital is finite - spend wisely
- Sometimes you inherit someone else's mistakes

**New Skills**:
- Reading the political tea leaves
- Building coalitions for hard decisions
- Managing out senior people gracefully
- Negotiating severance packages

#### VP Level
**What You Think**: "It's about strategy"
**What You Learn**: "It's about portfolio management"

**Key Realizations**:
- Every team needs a sacrifice for stack ranking
- Some battles aren't worth fighting
- Timing matters more than being right
- Your directs will have to fire people you hired

**New Skills**:
- Calibration horse-trading
- Managing out peers
- Protecting your people from above
- Taking bullets for your directs

#### C-Level
**What You Think**: "It's about vision"
**What You Learn**: "It's about survival"

**Key Realizations**:
- The board wants blood when numbers miss
- "Rightsizing" = someone fucked up hiring
- Your job is always on the line
- Even co-founders aren't safe

**New Skills**:
- Conducting layoffs humanely
- Managing investor expectations
- Rebuilding after cuts
- Knowing when to fall on sword

### The Brilliant Jerk Dilemma

**The Situation**: 10x engineer who makes everyone miserable

**The Calculation**:
```
Value Equation:
+ Incredible technical contributions
+ Deep system knowledge
+ Works 80-hour weeks
- Two people quit because of them
- Team morale in toilet
- No one wants to work with them
= Net negative (but try explaining that to leadership)
```

**The Playbook**:
1. **Document behavioral impact** (not just "culture fit")
2. **Quantify the cost** (attrition, productivity loss)
3. **Set behavioral expectations** as clearly as technical ones
4. **Create isolation strategy** (limit blast radius)
5. **Build replacement plan** before taking action
6. **Execute swiftly** once decision is made

### The Founder's Friend Problem

**The Reality**: They're untouchable until they're not

**Survival Strategies**:
- Never confront directly
- Document privately
- Build coalition carefully
- Wait for power shift
- Have exit plan ready

**Case Study**:
"Jake was employee #3, best friends with CTO. Completely incompetent, everyone knew it. Survived 3 managers who tried to fix it. Finally got moved to 'Special Projects' (corporate Siberia) when new CEO came in. Quit 6 months later."

### The Political Hire

**You Know Them**:
- VP's former colleague
- Board member's referral
- Customer's plant
- Diversity metric hire (yes, it happens)

**How to Handle**:
1. Set clear expectations immediately
2. Document everything from day 1
3. Give them rope to succeed or hang themselves
4. Build relationship with their sponsor
5. Have graceful exit strategy ready

## üòà The Calibration Game

### How Stack Ranking Really Works

**The Myth**: "We evaluate each person objectively"

**The Reality**: Horse trading in a conference room

**Real Calibration Dialogue**:
```
VP: "I need two more Exceeds Expectations for my retention cases"
You: "I'll give you one if you support my promotion case"
Peer: "If Jake gets Exceeds, I'm escalating"
VP: "Fine, who can we move to Meets?"
You: "Not my people, I already took the hit last cycle"
HR: "Someone needs to be Needs Improvement"
Everyone: "How about that guy who's leaving anyway?"
```

### Winning at Calibration

**Pre-Work** (Critical):
- Know your VP's priorities
- Build peer alliances
- Prepare sacrifice candidates
- Document outlier performance
- Practice your pitch

**During Calibration**:
- Speak first for each candidate
- Use specific metrics/examples
- Compare to peer teams
- Trade strategically
- Know when to fold

**The Unwritten Rules**:
1. New hires can't get top rating
2. Someone leaving = automatic bottom rating
3. Promotion candidates need top rating
4. If you don't fight, you lose
5. HR keeps score across cycles

## üé™ The Promotion Circus

### Why Promotions Really Happen

**What HR Says**: Merit, impact, leadership

**What Actually Matters**:
1. **Timing** (budget cycle, open headcount)
2. **Politics** (who owes whom)
3. **Optics** (diversity metrics, retention risks)
4. **Scarcity** (limited slots per level)
5. **Sponsorship** (who fights for you)
6. Oh, and merit (distant 6th)

### The Promotion Packet Reality

**What Goes in the Packet**:
```markdown
## Promotion Justification: [Name] to [Level]

## Executive Summary
One paragraph hitting: business impact, scope increase, 
leadership evidence, retention risk

## Business Impact
- Metric 1: $X revenue impact [specific project]
- Metric 2: Y% efficiency gain [specific improvement]
- Metric 3: Z headcount managed [growth trajectory]

## Scope Expansion
- Before: [smaller scope]
- Now: [bigger scope]
- Comparison: Already operating at [Level] scope

## Leadership Evidence
- Example 1: [Cross-functional influence]
- Example 2: [Strategic decision]
- Example 3: [Talent development]

## Retention Risk
- Market data: Could get [Level] elsewhere
- Flight risk: [High/Medium/Low]
- Impact if lost: [Quantify pain]

## Peer Comparison
- Peer 1 at [Level]: [Why candidate is equal/better]
- Peer 2 at [Level]: [Why candidate is equal/better]
```

**What Actually Gets Discussed**:
- "Didn't we just promote them?"
- "How many [Level] slots do we have?"
- "What's the diversity impact?"
- "Will they leave if we don't?"
- "Who else wants this slot?"

## üíî The Termination Talk

### The Most Humane Way to Fire Someone

**The Night Before**:
- Schedule early meeting (don't make them commute for nothing)
- Book private room
- Prepare paperwork
- Clear your calendar after
- Prepare yourself emotionally

**The Script**:
```
"I have difficult news. We've made the decision to eliminate your position, 
effective today. This decision is final.

Here's what happens next:
- Your last day is [date]
- Severance: [details]
- Benefits: [continuation info]
- Equipment: [return process]
- References: [what you'll say]

I know this is a shock. You don't need to respond now. [HR person] will 
go through details. I'll give you space, but I'm available if you need me."
```

**What NOT to Say**:
- "This is hard for me too" (it's not about you)
- "You'll land on your feet" (minimizing)
- "If it were up to me..." (passing blame)
- "Think of it as an opportunity" (toxic positivity)

**After the Meeting**:
- Let them leave immediately if they want
- Don't parade them out
- Send team notification same day
- Be available but don't hover
- Check in after a week (if appropriate)

## üõ°Ô∏è Protecting Yourself

### Document Everything

**The CYA Email Format**:
```
Subject: Following up on our discussion - [Topic]

Hi [Name],

As discussed in our 1:1 today, I want to confirm:

- Issue: [Specific performance problem]
- Impact: [How it affects team/business]
- Expectation: [What needs to change]

[Your name]

BCC: your personal email
```

### The Paper Trail

**Keep Records Of**:

- Impact on team/business
- Coaching provided
- Employee responses
- HR consultations

**Store It**:

## üó£Ô∏è Sophisticated Frameworks for Difficult Conversations

### The BRIDGE Framework for PIPs

**B** - Build Context
```
"I want to discuss your performance over the last [timeframe].
I've noticed [specific patterns] that concern me."
```

**R** - Reality Check
```
"This conversation is serious. Your job is at risk.
This is not a regular feedback session."
```

**I** - Impact Statement
```
"The impact includes: [team effects], [business effects], 
[specific examples with dates]"
```

**D** - Decision Point
```
"We're putting you on a formal improvement plan.
You have [timeframe] to meet these specific goals."
```

**G** - Guide Forward
```
"I recommend you: 1) Give maximum effort, 2) Start networking,
3) Use our EAP resources. How can I support you?"
```

**E** - End with Humanity
```
"I know this is difficult. Take time to process.
We can discuss details tomorrow if you prefer."
```

### The CARE Model for Terminations

**C** - Clear and Concise
```
"I have difficult news. We're ending your employment.
This decision is final. Your last day is [date]."
```

**A** - Administrative Details
```
"Here's what happens next: [severance], [benefits],
[equipment return], [reference policy]"
```

**R** - Respect and Recognition
```
"I want to acknowledge [specific contributions].
This decision doesn't diminish [positive qualities]."
```

**E** - Exit with Support
```
"[HR] will handle details. Take the time you need.
I'm available if you have questions later."
```

### The NAVIGATE Framework for Complex Situations

**N** - Notice patterns early
**A** - Assess impact objectively
**V** - Verify with peers/HR
**I** - Initiate documentation
**G** - Give clear feedback
**A** - Act decisively
**T** - Transition thoughtfully
**E** - Evaluate lessons learned

## üé§ Interview Guidance: Discussing This Sensitively

### When They Ask About Managing Poor Performers

**The Amateur Answer**:
"I coach them and help them improve. I believe everyone can succeed with the right support."

**The Sophisticated Answer**:
```
"I've learned that performance management requires balancing
compassion with decisiveness. My approach:

1. Early intervention - Address issues before they become patterns
2. Clear expectations - Specific, measurable, documented
3. Genuine support - Coaching, resources, adjusted roles
4. Decisive action - When improvement doesn't happen
5. Team protection - One person can't sink the ship

I've had to make difficult decisions, including terminations.
Each one taught me to act faster while maintaining humanity."
```

### When They Probe About Specific Situations

**The Framework Response**:
```
"I can share a sanitized example:

Situation: Senior engineer, brilliant technically, toxic behavior
Action: Documented impact, coaching, clear expectations, PIP
Result: No improvement, compassionate exit
Learning: Team productivity increased 30% after departure
Takeaway: Individual brilliance < team effectiveness"
```

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Don't Say**:
- "I've never had to fire anyone" (inexperienced)
- "HR handles that" (avoiding responsibility)
- "I give everyone multiple chances" (pushover)
- "I cut quickly" (potentially reckless)
- Details that could identify people

**Do Say**:
- "I balance compassion with business needs"
- "I've learned to act decisively after due process"
- "Team health is my primary responsibility"
- "Each situation taught me something valuable"
- "I partner with HR while owning the decision"

## üìñ Lessons from the Trenches

### The Time I Didn't Fire Someone Fast Enough

"Kept believing Tom would improve. 'He's trying,' I said. Meanwhile, two top performers left, team morale tanked, and my boss questioned my judgment. Finally fired him after 8 months. Team literally applauded. Lesson: Your instinct is usually right."

### The PIP That Actually Worked

"Maria was struggling after becoming a new parent. Instead of standard PIP, we created flexible arrangement: part-time for 2 months, gradual ramp back, adjusted expectations. She became my best lead. Lesson: Sometimes performance issues aren't about capability."

### The Brilliant Jerk I Couldn't Save

"Alex was legitimately genius-level. Also made three people cry, refused all feedback, thought management was stupid. Protected him for a year because 'valuable.' Lost four good engineers. Finally fired him. Team productivity went UP 30%. Lesson: No one is worth a toxic environment."

## üèõÔ∏è When Experience Becomes Wisdom

### The Evolution of Your Thinking

**Years 1-3: The Idealist**
- "Everyone deserves infinite chances"
- "I can fix anyone with enough coaching"
- "Firing means I failed as a manager"
- Avoid all conflict, hope problems resolve

**Years 4-7: The Realist**
- "Some people won't improve"
- "Fast and fair is better than slow"
- "The team matters more than individual"
- Document everything, act decisively

**Years 8-15: The Strategist**
- "Performance exists in context"
- "Sometimes reorganization > termination"
- "Political capital must be spent wisely"
- Know when to fight, when to fold

**Years 15+: The Philosopher**
- "Every decision has hidden costs"
- "Humanity and decisiveness can coexist"
- "Perfect is the enemy of good enough"
- Act with wisdom, accept imperfection

### The Meta-Lessons

1. **The Paradox of Caring**
   - Caring too much: You delay, team suffers
   - Caring too little: You're inhumane
   - Caring just right: Quick, fair, human

2. **The Documentation Dilemma**
   - Too little: Legal exposure
   - Too much: Paralysis by process
   - Just right: Cover bases, then act

3. **The Timing Truth**
   - Too early: Seem hasty
   - Too late: Lose credibility
   - Just right: Trust your gut

## üéØ Final Truths

### The Three Rules of Performance Management

1. **Fast and Fair** - Bad performers know they're bad. Good performers know they're good. Move quickly.

2. **Team Over Individual** - One bad apple really does spoil the bunch. Protect the many.

3. **Humanity in Execution** - You can fire someone and still treat them like a human being.

### The Ultimate Reality

Performance management is where theory meets reality. All your leadership philosophy means nothing if you can't make hard decisions about people. Do it wrong, and you lose your team's respect. Do it right, and they'll follow you anywhere.

The secret? There's no perfect way. There's only doing your best to be fair, be human, and be quick. The longer you wait, the more everyone suffers.

## üéì Interview Pro Tips: Advanced Handling

### When They Ask: "Tell me about a time you had to manage someone out"

**The Multi-Level Answer**:
```
"I'll share an example that taught me several lessons:

[Situation]: Senior engineer, great technical skills, poor collaboration
[Complexity]: Protected class member, close to CEO, critical project knowledge
[Process]: 3-month coaching, clear documentation, involved HR early
[Decision Point]: When two team members requested transfers
[Execution]: Compassionate PIP with genuine support, ultimately exited
[Result]: Team morale improved, productivity up 30%
[Learning]: I should have acted 2 months earlier
[Growth]: Now I address behavioral issues as seriously as technical ones"
```

### The Questions That Show Sophistication

**You Ask Them**:
1. "How does the company balance performance management with DEI goals?"
2. "What's the typical PIP success rate here, and how do you measure it?"
3. "How does calibration work across different divisions?"
4. "What support exists for managers making difficult people decisions?"
5. "How does the company handle performance issues at senior levels?"

**What You're Really Learning**:
- Question 1: Is DEI real or checkbox?
- Question 2: Are PIPs exit tools or development?
- Question 3: Is it political or fair?
- Question 4: Will you have air cover?
- Question 5: Does leadership eat its own dogfood?

### The Stories That Resonate

**For Director+ Roles**:
"I once inherited a team with three performance issues. Rather than three PIPs, I reorganized the team to better match skills to roles. Two thrived in new positions, one self-selected out. Sometimes the answer isn't individual performance management but organizational design."

**For VP+ Roles**:
"I had to manage out a peer who was a founder's hire. Built coalition carefully, documented business impact, created graceful exit as 'advisor.' Took 6 months but preserved relationships and team morale. Political capital well spent."

**For C-Level Roles**:
"Led a 20% reduction during funding crunch. Created fair criteria, gave generous severance, personally called each person. Rehired 30% when we recovered. The humanity during hard times defined our culture more than any mission statement."

*Remember: In interviews, they're not just evaluating your experience with performance management. They're assessing your judgment, humanity, and ability to make hard decisions. Show all three.*
