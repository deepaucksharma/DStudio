<h3>The Uncomfortable Truth</h3>

## üé≠ The Unspoken Rules

### Rule #1: Your Job is to Be Fired
The best engineering leaders build organizations that don't need them. If you're irreplaceable, you've failed.

### Rule #2: Culture Eats Everything
Not just strategy - culture eats process, tools, and good intentions for breakfast. One toxic senior engineer can destroy two years of culture building in two months.

### Rule #3: The Truth Has a Half-Life
By the time information reaches you, it's been filtered through three layers of "don't upset the boss." Multiply by 10x for bad news.

### Rule #4: Heroes Are Organizational Failures
If someone is constantly saving the day, you've failed to build proper systems. Heroes mask systematic problems.

### Rule #5: Your Calendar is Your Values
Show me your calendar, and I'll show you what you actually care about. Everything else is just talk.

## üíÄ Career-Ending Mistakes to Avoid

1. **The Friendship Trap**: Maintaining friendships with former peers you now manage
2. **The Transparency Fallacy**: Thinking you should share everything with your team
3. **The Technical Savior**: Jumping in to code when leadership is needed
4. **The Yes-Person**: Never pushing back on unrealistic demands
5. **The Absent Leader**: Being so strategic you lose touch with reality
