## Sample Story Structure

### High-Impact Technical Leadership Story
"Our mobile app was experiencing 30% increased crash rates after a major iOS update, affecting 50M daily users. Within 2 hours, I formed a war room with mobile, infrastructure, and product teams. I made the call to roll back the problematic feature while we investigated, preventing further user impact. Over the next 48 hours, I led the debugging effort, identified the root cause (memory management issue), and coordinated a proper fix. We shipped the resolution within a week, improved our mobile testing pipeline to catch similar issues, and saw user satisfaction scores recover to pre-incident levels. The experience taught us to be more proactive about platform changes and led to a 40% reduction in mobile crashes company-wide."

**Why This Works for Meta**:
- âœ… Quick decision making under pressure
- âœ… Quantified impact (50M users, specific metrics)
- âœ… Cross-functional leadership (mobile, infrastructure, product)
- âœ… Rapid execution (2 hours, 48 hours, 1 week)
- âœ… Systematic improvement and learning
