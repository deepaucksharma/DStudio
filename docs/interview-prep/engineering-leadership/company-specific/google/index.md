## Interview Process Structure

### L6 (Staff) to L8 (Director+) Process
- **4-5 Interview Rounds**: Technical leadership, behavioral, systems design
- **Hiring Committee Review**: Data-driven evaluation process
- **Executive Review**: For L7+ positions

### Key Assessment Areas
1. **Technical Leadership** (40%) - Architecture, innovation, technical strategy
2. **Googleyness** (30%) - Culture fit, collaboration, impact focus
3. **General Cognitive Ability** (20%) - Problem-solving, learning agility
4. **Role-Related Knowledge** (10%) - Domain expertise

## Core Google Values for Leaders

### 1. Focus on the User
**Leadership Application**:
- Make decisions that prioritize user experience over internal convenience

**Story Framework**:
"When faced with [technical trade-off], I chose [user-focused solution] over [easier internal solution] because [user impact data], resulting in [measurable user benefit] for [X million users]."

### 2. Think 10x, Not 10%
**Engineering Leadership Focus**:
- Identify opportunities for order-of-magnitude improvements
- Challenge assumptions about technical constraints
- Invest in transformational rather than incremental solutions

**L7+ Example Structure**:
"I recognized that our current approach to [system/process] was fundamentally limited. Instead of optimizing existing solutions, I proposed [revolutionary approach] that achieved [10x improvement] in [metric], enabling [new capabilities] for [impact scale]."

### 3. Technical Excellence
**Demonstration Areas**:
- Drive architectural decisions at org level
- Establish engineering standards and best practices
- Build systems that scale to Google's requirements
- Mentor other technical leaders

### 4. Collaboration and Inclusion
**Leadership Behaviors**:
- Build consensus across diverse teams
- Include different perspectives in decision-making
- Resolve conflicts constructively
- Champion underrepresented voices

## Technical Leadership Interview Deep Dive

### System Design for Leaders
