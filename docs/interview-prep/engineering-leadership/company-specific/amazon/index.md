## Overview

Amazon's interview process for engineering leaders (L6+) heavily focuses on Leadership Principles (LPs). You'll face 4-6 behavioral interviews, each targeting 2-3 specific LPs. Success requires demonstrating these principles at scale.

## The Bar Raiser Process

### What to Expect
- One interviewer is a trained Bar Raiser
- They have veto power over hiring decisions
- Focus on long-term potential, not just current skills
- Will dig deep with "Tell me more" follow-ups

### How to Prepare
- Have 2-3 stories per Leadership Principle
- Include failure stories (Learn and Be Curious)
- Quantify everything with data
- Show increasing scope over time

## L6+ Leadership Principles Deep Dive

### 1. Ownership (Critical for L6+)

**What It Means at Scale**:
- Own outcomes beyond your immediate team
- Think like a General Manager
- No "that's not my job" mentality
- Long-term thinking (3+ years)

**L6 Example Story Structure**:
"When our payment system reliability dropped to 97.5%, affecting $2M daily transactions, I owned the resolution despite payments being outside my direct scope. I formed a virtual team across 3 organizations, led the architecture review, and implemented a new monitoring system. Result: 99.99% reliability, saving $500K annually in failed transaction costs."

**Interview Questions**:
- "Tell me about a time you took ownership of something outside your area"
- "Describe a situation where you had to make a decision with long-term implications"
- "When have you sacrificed short-term gains for long-term value?"

### 2. Deliver Results (Table Stakes)

**L7+ Expectations**:
- Deliver business impact, not just features
- Handle multiple competing priorities
- Drive results through influence
- Overcome significant obstacles

**Key Metrics to Highlight**:
- Revenue impact ($X million)
- Cost savings (X% reduction)
- Performance improvements (Xms â†’ Yms)
- Team productivity (X% increase)

**Power Story Framework**:
"Despite [major obstacle], I delivered [specific result] by [innovative approach], resulting in [business impact] and [long-term benefit]."

### 3. Hire and Develop the Best

**Leadership Demonstration**:
- Building diverse teams from scratch
- Developing future leaders
- Creating talent pipelines
- Improving hiring processes

**L6 Story Example**:
"I raised our hiring bar by implementing structured interviews, resulting in offer acceptance increasing from 60% to 85% and new hire performance ratings improving by 30%. I personally mentored 5 engineers to promotion, with 2 becoming managers."

### 4. Think Big (L7+ Differentiator)

**Scale of Thinking**:
- L6: Transform your product area
- L7: Transform your organization  
- L8: Transform the company

**Story Elements**:
- Ambitious vision (10x, not 10%)
- Challenge status quo
- Inspire others to join
- Deliver step-function change

### 5. Earn Trust (Stakeholder Management)

**Engineering Leader Focus**:
- Transparent communication during outages
- Building credibility with non-technical leaders
- Admitting mistakes and showing growth
- Data-driven decision making

**Anti-patterns to Avoid**:
- Blaming others or circumstances
- Hiding problems until too late
- Over-promising and under-delivering
- Not admitting knowledge gaps

### 6. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

**Senior Leadership Nuance**:
- Disagree with senior leaders respectfully
- Know when to escalate vs commit
- Build coalition when needed
- Document decisions and rationale

**Story Structure**:
"I respectfully disagreed with [senior leader] about [technical decision] because [data/reasoning]. I proposed [alternative] and after healthy debate, we agreed to [outcome]. I then fully committed by [specific actions]."

### 7. Dive Deep (Technical Credibility)

**L6+ Balance**:
- Stay technical enough to make informed decisions
- Know when to dive deep vs delegate
- Use technical knowledge to unblock teams
- Identify systemic issues from details

## Interview Day Strategy

### Interview Loop Structure
1. **Hiring Manager**: Overall fit + 2-3 LPs
2. **Skip Level**: Think Big, Ownership
3. **Peer Managers**: Earn Trust, Deliver Results  
4. **Bar Raiser**: Any LPs, culture fit
5. **Technical**: Dive Deep, Think Big

### STAR Story Bank

Create 15-20 stories covering:
- Scaling teams (Hire and Develop)
- Technical migrations (Ownership, Think Big)
- Conflict resolution (Earn Trust, Backbone)
- Failure recovery (Learn and Be Curious)
- Process improvements (Insist on High Standards)

### The "Tell Me More" Technique

Be prepared for 3-4 follow-ups:
1. Initial story (2 minutes)
2. "What was your specific role?" (30 seconds)
3. "What would you do differently?" (30 seconds)
4. "How did you measure success?" (30 seconds)
5. "What was the lasting impact?" (30 seconds)

## Red Flags for Amazon

### Avoid These
- ðŸš« "My team did X" without your specific contribution
- ðŸš« Perfect success stories with no learnings
- ðŸš« Blaming AWS/tools/process for failures
- ðŸš« Not knowing your metrics/data
- ðŸš« Short-term thinking

### Embrace These
- âœ… "I failed at X, learned Y, applied it to Z"
- âœ… Specific mechanisms you created
- âœ… Customer obsession in every story
- âœ… Data-driven decisions
- âœ… Bias for action examples
