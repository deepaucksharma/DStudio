# Decision Trees

> **Note**: This interactive tool is under development.

## Overview

The Decision Trees interactive tool provides systematic frameworks for complex engineering leadership decision-making scenarios commonly encountered in technical interviews. This comprehensive training platform guides candidates through structured decision analysis, trade-off evaluation, stakeholder consideration, and outcome optimization using proven decision-making methodologies and real-world engineering leadership challenges.

## Features (Coming Soon)

- **Interactive practice interface** - Dynamic decision scenario simulation with branching logic and consequence modeling
- **Real-time feedback** - Immediate evaluation of decision quality, reasoning process, and consideration completeness
- **Progress tracking** - Comprehensive analytics on decision-making patterns, improvement trends, and readiness metrics
- **Customizable scenarios** - Tailored decision challenges based on leadership level, technical domain, and organizational context
