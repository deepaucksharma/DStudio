## üé≠ Scenario Library

### 1. Managing an Underperformer
**Complexity**: High  
**Key Skills**: Performance management, empathy, documentation, legal awareness

**Starting Situation**: Your senior engineer (L5, 5 years tenure) has been underperforming for 3 months. Previously a top performer, their code quality has dropped, they're missing deadlines, and team members are complaining.

**Decision Points**:
- Initial approach (1:1 vs team meeting vs HR involvement)
- Root cause investigation
- Support vs accountability balance
- Timeline and milestones
- Team communication strategy

### 2. Team Conflict Resolution
**Complexity**: Very High  
**Key Skills**: Mediation, cultural awareness, team dynamics, fairness

**Starting Situation**: Two senior engineers on your team aren't speaking to each other after a heated code review. The team is splitting into factions, impacting productivity.

**Decision Points**:
- Immediate intervention strategy
- Individual vs group approach
- Technical vs interpersonal focus
- Long-term team structure
- Prevention measures

### 3. Organizational Restructure
**Complexity**: Extreme  
**Key Skills**: Strategic thinking, communication, change management

**Starting Situation**: Company pivoting from B2C to B2B. Your 40-person org needs restructuring from functional teams to business-aligned teams. Morale is low due to rumors.

**Decision Points**:
- Communication strategy
- Team formation approach
- Timeline decisions
- People placement
- Managing resistance

### 4. Production Crisis
**Complexity**: High  
**Key Skills**: Crisis management, technical judgment, communication

**Starting Situation**: Major outage affecting 50% of users. Root cause unknown. CEO asking for updates every 30 minutes. Team is panicking.

**Decision Points**:
- Incident commander selection
- Communication cadence
- Resource allocation
- Risk decisions
- Post-mortem approach

### 5. Difficult Hiring Decision
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Key Skills**: Hiring judgment, team dynamics, diversity awareness

**Starting Situation**: Final round candidate is technically brilliant but multiple interviewers flagged culture concerns. Team desperately needs senior talent.

**Decision Points**:
- Weighting of feedback
- Additional assessment
- Team involvement
- Offer decisions
- Risk mitigation

## üß≠ Decision Framework

### The DECIDE Model
- **D**efine the problem clearly
- **E**stablish criteria for solutions
- **C**onsider alternatives
- **I**dentify best alternatives
- **D**evelop implementation plan
- **E**valuate and monitor

### Key Principles
1. **Reversible vs Irreversible**: One-way vs two-way doors
2. **Blast Radius**: Who/what is affected?
3. **Time Sensitivity**: Urgent vs Important matrix
4. **Information Completeness**: Known unknowns
5. **Stakeholder Impact**: RACI analysis
