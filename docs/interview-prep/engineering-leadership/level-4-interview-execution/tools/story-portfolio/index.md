    B --> C[Deep Dive<br/>5-10 minutes]
    C --> D[Technical Deep Dive<br/>15+ minutes]
    
    A2[Quick Impact] --> A
    B2[Full Context] --> B
    C2[Decision Process] --> C
    D2[Implementation] --> D
```

## Story Development Process

### Step 1: Story Mining
**Brainstorming Prompts**:
- Biggest failure that taught you the most?
- Time you influenced without authority?
- Most complex technical decision?
- Hardest people decision?
- Project you're most proud of?
- Time you changed company direction?

### Step 2: Story Structuring

**Enhanced STAR+ Template**:
```markdown
# Story Title: [Descriptive Name]

```

### Dynamic Story Selection

**Selection Criteria**:
1. **Interviewer Background**: Technical vs Business vs HR
2. **Role Level**: Scope expectations (team vs org vs company)
3. **Company Stage**: Startup vs growth vs mature
4. **Recent Events**: Related to company challenges
5. **Previous Rounds**: Avoid repetition, show range

## Story Practice Framework

### Solo Practice Routine
```yaml
Daily (10 minutes):
  - Practice one story out loud
  - Time yourself (aim for 2 minutes)
  - Record and review

Weekly (30 minutes):
  - Deep dive into one story
  - Add new metrics/details
  - Practice variations

Monthly (2 hours):
  - Full portfolio review
  - Update with recent accomplishments
  - Mock interview with all stories
```

### Peer Practice Sessions
```yaml
Format: 60-minute session
  - Warm-up: 5 minutes
  - Story rounds: 40 minutes (4-5 stories)
  - Feedback: 15 minutes

Feedback Framework:
  - Clarity: Was the story easy to follow?
  - Impact: Was the impact compelling?
  - Authenticity: Did it feel genuine?
  - Relevance: Did it address the question?
```

## Story Refinement Techniques

### Power Moves
- **The Hook**: Start with surprising outcome
- **The Pivot**: Show adaptability mid-story
- **The Scale**: Zoom from tactical to strategic
- **The Learning**: Vulnerable but growth-minded

### Common Story Upgrades

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "I led a team" | "I led 12 engineers across 3 time zones" |
| "We improved performance" | "We reduced p99 latency by 73% (450ms → 122ms)" |
| "It was successful" | "Generated $3.2M ARR in first 6 months, exceeding target by 28%" |
| "I learned a lot" | "This experience fundamentally changed how I approach X, which I later applied to Y with Z result" |

## Story Portfolio Maintenance

**Unique Angle**: [What makes this special]
**Time**: [30s | 2m | 5m | 10m versions]
```

## Red Flags in Story Portfolio

### Portfolio-Level Issues
- ❌ All stories from same time period
- ❌ No failure or learning stories
- ❌ Only technical or only people stories
- ❌ No stories showing executive interaction
- ❌ All hero narratives (no team success)

### Story-Level Issues
- ❌ Vague metrics ("significantly improved")
- ❌ Blaming others for failures
- ❌ Taking credit for team's work
- ❌ No clear personal contribution
- ❌ Outcome doesn't match buildup

## Advanced Techniques

### Story Chaining
Link stories for deeper impact:
- "This reminds me of another situation where..."
- "The learning from X helped me handle Y..."
- "This built the foundation for [bigger story]..."

### Meta-Narratives
Weave stories into larger themes:
- Innovation thread across multiple stories
- Leadership evolution journey
- Building and scaling excellence

### Defensive Storytelling
Prepare for tough follow-ups:
- "What would you do differently?"
- "Why did it take so long?"
- "Seems like you should have seen that coming?"
