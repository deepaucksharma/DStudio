## Technical Leadership Competencies

### 1. System Design at Scale

**Key Topics to Master**:
- Distributed systems principles (CAP, consensus, coordination)
- Data systems (OLTP, OLAP, streaming, caching)

- Observability (metrics, logging, tracing, SLOs)
- Security (zero trust, encryption, compliance)

**Leadership Angle**:
- Building vs buying decisions
- Technology standardization
- Platform team strategy
- Developer productivity

### 2. Technical Strategy

**Strategic Frameworks**:
```
Technology Radar:
- Adopt: Proven technologies for broad use
- Trial: Promising tech for specific cases  
- Assess: Worth investigating
- Hold: Avoid new investments

Technical Debt Management:
- Measure: Debt ratio, maintenance burden
- Prioritize: Risk vs. business impact
- Allocate: 20% capacity for debt reduction
- Track: Debt burndown metrics
```

### 3. Engineering Excellence

**Culture Building**:
- Code review practices
- Testing philosophy (unit, integration, E2E)
- CI/CD maturity
- Operational excellence
- Documentation standards

**Metrics-Driven Approach**:
| Metric Category | Example KPIs | Leadership Actions |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Velocity** | Deployment frequency, lead time | Remove bottlenecks, automate |
| **Quality** | Defect rate, MTTR, test coverage | Invest in testing, monitoring |
| **Efficiency** | Build time, resource utilization | Optimize pipelines, right-size |
| **Innovation** | Experimentation rate, tech debt ratio | Allocate innovation time |

## Technical Communication
