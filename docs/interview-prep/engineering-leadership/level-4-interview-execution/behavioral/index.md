## Advanced Behavioral Techniques

### The Pivot Method
When the interviewer asks for a different example:
```
"I have another example that might be even more relevant - 
it shows the same principle but in a different context..."
```

### The Depth Ladder
Be prepared for 5 levels of "why":
1. Surface action: "We implemented code reviews"
2. Tactical reason: "To improve code quality"
3. Strategic reason: "To reduce production incidents"
4. Business reason: "To improve customer trust"
5. Philosophy: "Because sustainable pace requires quality"

### The Failure Framework
Structure for discussing failures:
```
1. Context: "Here's what we were trying to achieve..."
2. Decision: "Based on X, we decided Y..."
3. Failure: "It didn't work because..."
4. Recovery: "Here's how we recovered..."
5. Learning: "This fundamentally changed how I..."
6. Application: "I later applied this when..."
```
