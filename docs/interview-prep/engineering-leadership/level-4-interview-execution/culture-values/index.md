# Culture & Values Interview Guide

## Overview

Culture and values interviews assess your authentic alignment with company principles, your ability to shape and evolve culture, and your track record of creating inclusive, high-performing environments. These interviews go beyond mere "culture fit" to evaluate "culture add."

- Outcome: Cultural evolution
