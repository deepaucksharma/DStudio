## ðŸ’¡ How to Use These Problems

### 1. Choose Based on Interview Target
- **FAANG**: Focus on scale (ML Serving, IoT Platform)
- **Startups**: Focus on practical systems (CI/CD, Cloud Storage)
- **Domain-specific**: Pick relevant problems

### 2. Practice Approach
1. **Understand Requirements** (5-10 min)
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Scale estimates

2. **High-Level Design** (10-15 min)
   - Major components
   - Data flow
   - API design

3. **Detailed Design** (20-30 min)
   - Data models
   - Algorithms
   - System architecture

4. **Scale & Optimize** (10-15 min)
   - Bottleneck analysis
   - Caching strategy
   - Data partitioning

5. **Trade-offs & Alternatives** (5-10 min)
   - Design choices
   - Technology selection
   - Cost considerations

### 3. Key Skills to Demonstrate
- **Requirements gathering** - Ask clarifying questions
- **Estimation** - Back-of-envelope calculations
- **Trade-off analysis** - No perfect solutions
- **Incremental design** - Start simple, then scale
- **Best practices** - Security, monitoring, testing

## ðŸ“– Study Resources

### Before Practice
- Review [System Design Frameworks](../ic-interviews/frameworks/)
- Study [Common Patterns](../pattern-library/)
- Check [Scalability Numbers](../ic-interviews/cheatsheets/)

### During Practice
- Use [System Design Checklist](../ic-interviews/cheatsheets/system-design-checklist.md)
- Follow consistent approach
- Time yourself

### After Practice
- Compare with solutions
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Practice explaining out loud

## ðŸŽª Problem Selection Strategy

### Week 1-2: Fundamentals
Start with storage and infrastructure problems to build foundation

### Week 3-4: Intermediate Systems
Practice real-time collaboration and development tools
