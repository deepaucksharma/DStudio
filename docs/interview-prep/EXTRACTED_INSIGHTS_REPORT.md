## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the company-specific interview content in `google-interviews/` and `amazon-interviews/` directories to extract valuable general insights that should be preserved in the new `interview-prep/` section while removing company-specific branding.

Extract the concept of integrating behavioral principles with technical design:
- **Customer-first design thinking**
- **Long-term ownership mentality**
- **Innovation and simplification**
- **Data-driven decision making**
- **Operational excellence**
- **Cost awareness**

**Action:** Generalize as "How to demonstrate soft skills through technical design choices."

## Content to Move to Case Studies

### System Walkthroughs
These detailed system designs are better suited as case studies:

1. **YouTube System Design** (`youtube-walkthrough.md`)
   → Move to: `case-studies/video-streaming/youtube-design.md`

2. **Gmail System Design** (`gmail-walkthrough.md`)
   → Move to: `case-studies/communication/gmail-design.md`

3. **Maps System Design** (`maps-walkthrough.md`)
   → Move to: `case-studies/location/google-maps-design.md`

4. **Spanner Deep Dive** (`spanner.md`)
   → Move to: `case-studies/databases/google-spanner.md`

5. **DynamoDB Design** (`amazon-interviews/dynamodb.md`)
   → Move to: `case-studies/databases/amazon-dynamodb.md`

## Content to Delete

### Too Company-Specific
- `google-interviews/google-patterns.md` - Very Google-specific patterns
- `google-interviews/google-ads.md` - Product-specific design
- `google-interviews/interview-experiences.md` - Anecdotal, company-specific
- `google-interviews/dashboard.md` - Navigation/index page
- Various stub files with minimal content

### Outdated or Redundant
- Multiple overlapping cheat sheets
- Company-specific scale examples
- Internal technology references
- Recruitment process details

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract and Generalize
1. Create new files in `interview-prep/` with generalized content
2. Remove all company branding and specific technology names
3. Replace company examples with generic industry examples
4. Maintain the valuable frameworks and methodologies

### Phase 2: Move Case Studies
1. Relocate detailed system walkthroughs to appropriate case study sections
2. Add learning objectives and key takeaways
3. Link from interview prep materials as examples

### Phase 3: Clean Up
1. Delete company-specific directories after extraction
2. Update navigation to point to new locations
3. Ensure all internal links are updated

## Key Preservation Principles

1. **Keep the frameworks, lose the branding** - Valuable evaluation rubrics and methodologies should be preserved as industry best practices
2. **Generalize scale discussions** - Instead of "Google scale," discuss "large scale" with concrete numbers
3. **Extract patterns, not implementations** - Focus on the thought process and approach, not specific technologies
4. **Maintain practical tools** - Checklists, templates, and worksheets are valuable regardless of company
5. **Preserve learning paths** - Study plans and roadmaps are universally applicable

## Summary

The company-specific interview sections contain approximately 60-70% generalizable content that provides significant value for interview preparation. By extracting and generalizing this content, we can create a comprehensive interview preparation guide that serves all readers while reducing redundancy and removing potential legal concerns around company-specific information.

The remaining 30-40% consists of company-specific examples, internal technologies, and anecdotal content that should either be moved to case studies (for educational value) or deleted (if too specific or outdated).
