Part IV Preview: Quantitative Toolkit
Having explored patterns that emerge from axioms and pillars, Part IV provides the mathematical tools to make informed decisions. You'll learn to:

Calculate theoretical limits
Model system behavior
Predict scaling characteristics
Optimize cost-performance trade-offs
Capacity plan with confidence

The math that matters for distributed systems...RetryDcontinueEditMapped out quantitative toolkit for distributed systems analysis.6sThe user wants me to continue with Part IV of the book outline - the Quantitative Toolkit (pages 65-74). This section focuses on mathematical tools and models for distributed systems. Based on the established pattern, I should provide comprehensive expansions of each page while maintaining the practical, first-principles approach.
I need to cover:
