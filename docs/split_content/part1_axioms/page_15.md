Page 15: AXIOM 8 â€“ Economic Gradient
Learning Objective: Every technical decision is an economic decision in disguise.
The Money-Time-Quality Triangle:
In distributed systems, pick two:
- Cheap + Fast = Not reliable
- Fast + Reliable = Not cheap  
- Cheap + Reliable = Not fast

Examples:
- S3: Cheap + Reliable (eventual consistency)
- DynamoDB: Fast + Reliable (expensive)
- Spot instances: Cheap + Fast (can disappear)
ðŸŽ¬ Failure Vignette: The Analytics Bill Shock
Company: Social media analytics startup
Month 1 bill: $2,000 (as expected)
Month 2 bill: $2,500 (small growth)
Month 3 bill: $28,000 (!!)

Investigation:
- New feature: Real-time sentiment analysis
- Architecture: Lambda function per tweet
- Volume: 10M tweets/day
- Lambda cost: $0.20 per 1M requests
- Kinesis cost: $0.015 per 1M records
- DynamoDB cost: $0.25 per million writes

Daily cost breakdown:
- Lambda invocations: 10M Ã— $0.20/1M = $2
- Kinesis records: 10M Ã— $0.015/1M = $0.15
- DynamoDB writes: 10M Ã— $0.25/1M = $2.50
- But wait...

The hidden multiplier:
- Each tweet â†’ 5 Lambda retries on average
- Each retry â†’ New Kinesis record
- Each retry â†’ New DynamoDB write
- Actual daily: $23 Ã— 30 = $690
- Plus data transfer, CloudWatch, etc.

Root cause: Retry storm on throttling
Fix: Batch processing, reduced bill to $3,000/month
Cost Dynamics in Distributed Systems:
Linear Costs (predictable):
- Storage: $/GB/month
- Bandwidth: $/GB transferred
- Compute: $/hour

Super-linear Costs (dangerous):
- Cross-region traffic: NÃ—(N-1) connections
- Monitoring: Every metric costs
- Coordination: Consensus overhead

Step-function Costs (surprising):
- Free tier â†’ Paid (infinite % increase)
- Single AZ â†’ Multi-AZ (2x)
- Regional â†’ Global (3-5x)
ðŸŽ¯ Decision Tree: Serverless vs Servers
What's your traffic pattern?
â”œâ”€ Spiky/Unpredictable
â”‚  â”œâ”€ < 1M requests/month â†’ Serverless
â”‚  â””â”€ > 1M requests/month â†’ Check duty cycle
â”‚     â”œâ”€ < 20% utilized â†’ Serverless
â”‚     â””â”€ > 20% utilized â†’ Servers
â””â”€ Steady/Predictable
   â”œâ”€ Can use spot/preemptible?
   â”‚  â””â”€ YES â†’ Servers with spot
   â””â”€ Need high availability?
      â””â”€ Servers with reserved instances
The True Cost Formula:
TCO = Infrastructure + Operations + Development + Opportunity

Where:
- Infrastructure: AWS/GCP/Azure bill
- Operations: Engineer time, on-call
- Development: Building + maintaining
- Opportunity: What you couldn't build

Example: Build vs Buy Database
Build: $50K/month infra + $200K/month engineers = $250K
Buy: $100K/month managed service
Opportunity cost of 2 engineers: 2 features/month
â†’ Buy wins
Cost Anti-Patterns:

Invisible Waste: Unused resources running 24/7
Premium by Default: Using most expensive tier
Retention Forever: Storing all data infinitely
Over-provisioning: 10x capacity "just in case"
Cross-region Everything: Replicating unnecessarily
