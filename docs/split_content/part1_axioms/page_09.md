Page 9: AXIOM 5 â€“ Cost of Coordination
Learning Objective: Coordination is expensive in time, money, and complexity.
The Coordination Tax Formula:
Total Cost = Communication Cost + Consensus Cost + Failure Handling Cost

Where:
- Communication = N Ã— (N-1) Ã— message_cost
- Consensus = rounds Ã— round_trip_time Ã— N
- Failure = retry_probability Ã— recovery_cost
ðŸŽ¬ Failure Vignette: The $2M Two-Phase Commit
Company: Global financial services
Scenario: Cross-region transaction coordination
Architecture: 2PC across 5 data centers

Per Transaction Cost:
- Singapore â†” London: 170ms RTT
- London â†” New York: 70ms RTT  
- New York â†” SF: 65ms RTT
- SF â†” Tokyo: 100ms RTT
- Tokyo â†” Singapore: 75ms RTT

2PC Phases:
1. Prepare: Coordinator â†’ All (parallel): 170ms
2. Vote collection: All â†’ Coordinator: 170ms
3. Commit: Coordinator â†’ All: 170ms
Total: 510ms minimum per transaction

Monthly volume: 100M transactions
Time cost: 510ms Ã— 100M = 14,000 hours of coordination
AWS cross-region traffic: $0.02/GB
Message size: 1KB Ã— 3 phases Ã— 5 regions = 15KB
Monthly bill: 15KB Ã— 100M Ã— $0.02 = $30M

Actual bill (with retries, monitoring): $2M/month

Solution: Eventual consistency with regional aggregation
New cost: $50K/month (40x reduction)
Coordination Patterns Ranked by Cost:
Pattern              Time Cost    Money Cost    Complexity
-------              ---------    ----------    ----------
No coordination      0            $0            Simple
Gossip protocol      O(log N)     Low           Medium
Leader election      O(1) amort   Medium        Medium
Quorum (majority)    O(1)         Medium        Medium
2PC                  O(N)         High          High
3PC                  O(N)         Very High     Very High
Paxos/Raft          O(1) amort   Medium        High

ðŸŽ¯ Decision Framework: Coordination Necessity
Do you REALLY need coordination?
â”œâ”€ Can you tolerate inconsistency?
â”‚  â””â”€ YES â†’ Use eventual consistency
â”œâ”€ Can you partition the problem?
â”‚  â””â”€ YES â†’ Coordinate within partitions only
â”œâ”€ Can you use a single writer?
â”‚  â””â”€ YES â†’ No coordination needed
â”œâ”€ Can you use conflict-free data types?
â”‚  â””â”€ YES â†’ Merge without coordination
â””â”€ NO to all â†’ Accept the coordination cost
              â””â”€ Choose cheapest sufficient protocol
The Hidden Costs:

Developer Time: Complex protocols = bugs
Operational: More moving parts = more failures
Latency: Every round trip adds delay
Availability: More participants = lower availability
Debugging: Distributed traces are expensive
