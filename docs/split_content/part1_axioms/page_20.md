Part II Preview
Having established the 8 fundamental axioms that govern all distributed systems, Part II will show how these constraints combine to create the three foundational pillars of distributed system design:

Distribution of Work: How to spread computation (emerges from Capacity + Latency axioms)
Distribution of State: How to spread data (emerges from Capacity + Partial Failure + Latency)
Distribution of Truth: How to achieve agreement (emerges from Coordination + Concurrency + Partial Failure)

And two modern extensions:
4. Distribution of Control: How to manage the system (emerges from Human Interface + Observability)
5. Distribution of Intelligence: How to make systems adaptive (emerges from all axioms + feedback loops)
These pillars aren't arbitrary categorizationsâ€”they're the natural solutions that emerge when you apply first-principles thinking to the fundamental constraints we've just explored.
Let me continue with Part II in the next response...RetryDcontinueEditMapped out comprehensive expansion strategy for document sections.7sThe user wants me to continue with the comprehensive expansion. I've covered the front matter and Part I (Axiom-Based Foundation, pages 1-20) in detail. Now I need to continue with Part II: Foundational Pillars & Modern Extensions (pages 21-44).
I should maintain the same level of detail and first-principles approach, including:

Learning objectives
Core principles
Visual diagrams/examples
Failure vignettes
Decision frameworks
Try This exercises
Counter-intuitive truths
Mathematical foundations where relevant

Let me continue with pages 21-44, covering the pillars and extensions.Response 4: PART II - Foundational Pillars & Modern Extensions (Pages 21-44)
