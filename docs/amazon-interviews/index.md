# Amazon System Design Interview Guide

## Overview: What Makes Amazon Different

Amazon's system design interviews are unique in the tech industry. While other companies focus primarily on technical architecture, Amazon evaluates candidates through the lens of their **Leadership Principles**, expecting you to demonstrate not just technical excellence but also operational rigor, customer obsession, and long-term thinking.

### The Amazon Way

Amazon builds systems that:
- **Start with the customer and work backwards**
- **Operate at massive scale** (millions of requests per second)
- **Maintain Day 1 mentality** - staying nimble despite size
- **Optimize for long-term value** over short-term gains
- **Embrace frugality** as a forcing function for innovation

## Key Differences from Other Tech Companies

### 1. **Operational Excellence Focus**
Amazon expects you to think like an operator, not just an architect:
- How will you monitor this system?
- What are the runbooks for common issues?
- How do you handle on-call?
- What metrics define success?

### 2. **Cost Consciousness**
Every design decision should consider cost:
- Infrastructure costs
- Operational costs
- Development costs
- Opportunity costs

### 3. **Working Backwards**
Start with a press release, then design:
- What's the customer problem?
- How does your solution delight customers?
- What's the minimum lovable product?

### 4. **Two-Pizza Teams**
Design for small, autonomous teams:
- Clear service boundaries
- Well-defined APIs
- Independent deployment
- Full ownership model

### 5. **Mechanisms, Not Good Intentions**
Build systems that enforce good behavior:
- Automated testing
- Deployment pipelines
- Monitoring and alerting
- Self-healing systems
