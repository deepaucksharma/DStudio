# FinOps

!!! info "Pattern Overview"
    **Category**: cost-optimization  
    **Complexity**: Medium  
    **Use Cases**: cloud cost management, financial governance, resource optimization

## Problem

Cloud costs can spiral out of control without proper governance. Teams lack visibility into spending, resources are over-provisioned, and there is no accountability for cost optimization.

## Solution

FinOps combines financial accountability with operational excellence. It provides cost visibility, optimization recommendations, budget controls, and cultural practices for cost-conscious engineering.

## Implementation

```python
# Example implementation
class FinOpsManager:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Provides cost transparency
- Enables proactive optimization
- Improves financial accountability

**Cons:**
- Increases operational overhead
- Requires cultural change requirements
- May impact tooling investments

## When to Use

- When you need cloud-native organizations
- For systems that require cost optimization initiatives
- In scenarios with budget governance needs
