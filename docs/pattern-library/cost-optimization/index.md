# Cost Optimization Patterns

Cost optimization in cloud environments requires systematic approaches to resource management, pricing strategies, and operational efficiency. These patterns help organizations reduce costs while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Pattern Categories

### Resource Management
- [Spot Instance Management](spot-instance-management/index.md) - Leverage low-cost compute capacity
- [Resource Rightsizing](resource-rightsizing/index.md) - Optimize resource allocation
- [Reserved Capacity Planning](reserved-capacity-planning/index.md) - Strategic capacity commitment

### Multi-Cloud Strategy
- [Multi-Cloud Arbitrage](multi-cloud-arbitrage/index.md) - Optimize across cloud providers
- [Cost Allocation and Chargeback](cost-allocation-chargeback/index.md) - Transparent cost management

## Quick Selection Guide

| Problem | Start With | Then Add |
|---------|------------|----------|
| High compute costs | Spot Instance Management | Resource Rightsizing |
| Over-provisioning | Resource Rightsizing | Reserved Capacity Planning |
| Vendor lock-in costs | Multi-Cloud Arbitrage | Cost Allocation |
| Cost visibility | Cost Allocation | All optimization patterns |
| Long-term planning | Reserved Capacity Planning | Multi-Cloud Arbitrage |

## Real-World Impact

- **Airbnb**: 30% cost reduction through spot instances and rightsizing
- **Netflix**: $100M+ annual savings through reserved capacity planning
- **Spotify**: 40% cost reduction via multi-cloud arbitrage
- **Pinterest**: 50% reduction in compute costs through optimization
