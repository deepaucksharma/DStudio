# Cell-Based Architecture Pattern

!!! warning "ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Advanced isolation pattern with high complexity**
    
    Cell-based architecture provides excellent isolation and scaling properties but requires significant engineering investment. Best suited for large-scale systems where failure isolation justifies the complexity.
    
    **Best suited for:**
    - Large multi-tenant platforms
    - Services requiring compliance isolation
    - Systems where blast radius must be minimized
    - Organizations with mature engineering practices

**Isolate failures and scale independently with cellular architecture**

## Overview

Cell-based architecture divides a system into multiple isolated cells, each capable of serving a subset of users independently. This pattern provides fault isolation, independent scaling, and simplified operations.

## Key Concepts

- **Cell**: Self-contained unit with all necessary components
- **Cell Router**: Directs users to appropriate cells
- **Isolation**: Cells don't share state or dependencies
- **Blast Radius**: Failures limited to single cell

## Common Use Cases

- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
- Geographic distribution
- Compliance boundaries
- Failure isolation
