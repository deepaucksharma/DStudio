## The Complete Blueprint

Cell-based architecture is a deployment and isolation pattern that partitions applications into independent, self-contained units (cells) with shared-nothing architecture, enabling complete failure isolation and independent scaling. This pattern addresses the challenge of blast radius containment by ensuring that failures in one cell cannot propagate to other cells, making it ideal for large-scale, multi-tenant systems where availability is critical. Each cell contains all the resources needed to serve a subset of users - including compute, storage, networking, and data - creating natural boundaries that prevent cascading failures. The key insight is that by accepting some resource duplication overhead, you gain predictable failure domains, simplified capacity planning, and the ability to perform maintenance or updates on individual cells without affecting the entire system.

### What You'll Master

- **Cell partitioning strategies**: Design user and data partitioning schemes that evenly distribute load while maintaining isolation
- **Routing and discovery**: Implement intelligent routing systems that direct requests to the correct cell based on user, geography, or tenant
- **Cross-cell operations**: Handle rare operations that span multiple cells while maintaining the isolation guarantees
- **Operational management**: Establish procedures for cell provisioning, decommissioning, monitoring, and disaster recovery

# Cell-Based Architecture Pattern

!!! warning "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Advanced isolation pattern with high complexity**
    
    Cell-based architecture provides excellent isolation and scaling properties but requires significant engineering investment. Best suited for large-scale systems where failure isolation justifies the complexity.
    
    **Production Success:**
    - AWS: Entire infrastructure built on cells
    - Slack: Isolated customer workspaces
    - Salesforce: Multi-tenant isolation

## Essential Questions

**1. Do you need hard isolation between customer groups?**
- YES ‚Üí Cells provide complete isolation
- NO ‚Üí Consider simpler multi-tenancy

**2. Can you afford 20-30% infrastructure overhead?**
- YES ‚Üí Cells duplicate resources for isolation
- NO ‚Üí Shared infrastructure more efficient

**3. Is your team experienced with distributed systems?**
- YES ‚Üí Can handle cell complexity
- NO ‚Üí Start with simpler patterns

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use Cell-Based When

| Scenario | Why It Works | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Compliance requirements** | Data isolation by region/customer | Healthcare SaaS |
| **Large multi-tenant** | Isolate noisy neighbors | Salesforce |
| **Variable workloads** | Scale cells independently | Gaming platforms |
| **Failure isolation critical** | Limit blast radius | Financial services |
| **Geographic distribution** | Cells per region | Global SaaS |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why It Fails | Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **< 100 tenants** | Overhead too high | Shared infrastructure |
| **Tight data coupling** | Cross-cell queries complex | Monolithic database |
| **Small team** | Operational burden | Simpler architecture |
| **Cost sensitive** | 20-30% overhead | Resource pooling |
| **Frequent cross-tenant** | Cell boundaries problematic | Shared services |
