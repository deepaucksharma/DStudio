## Essential Question

**How do we structure our system architecture to leverage kappa architecture?**



# Kappa Architecture

!!! danger "ü•â Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Superseded by more practical approaches**
    
    Kappa architecture's pure streaming approach seemed elegant but proved impractical for many use cases. Lambda architecture and modern unified processing frameworks offer better solutions.
    
    **Use modern alternatives:**
    - **Apache Beam** for unified batch/stream processing
    - **Flink** for stateful stream processing
    - **Kafka Streams** for event streaming

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |
