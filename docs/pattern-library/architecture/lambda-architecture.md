## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |
# Lambda Architecture

!!! danger "ü•â Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Replaced by unified processing frameworks**
    
    Lambda architecture's dual pipeline approach (batch + stream) created operational complexity. Modern unified processing frameworks eliminate the need for maintaining separate systems.
    
    **Use modern alternatives:**
    - **Apache Beam** for unified batch/stream
    - **Delta Lake/Iceberg** for lakehouse architectures
    - **Flink/Spark Structured Streaming** for unified processing

**Hybrid approach combining batch and stream processing for complete data analytics**

> *"Lambda architecture attempted to get the best of both worlds - batch accuracy and stream latency - but ended up with the complexity of both."*

## Essential Questions for Architects

### ü§î Key Decision Points

1. **Do you need both historical and real-time views?**
   - Only real-time ‚Üí Use stream processing
   - Only historical ‚Üí Use batch processing
   - Both required ‚Üí Consider Lambda (or modern unified)

2. **Can you tolerate eventual consistency?**
   - Strong consistency needed ‚Üí Avoid Lambda
   - Eventual consistency OK ‚Üí Lambda viable
   - Read-after-write needed ‚Üí Stream-only better

3. **What's your operational capacity?**
   - Limited ops team ‚Üí Avoid Lambda
   - Mature ops ‚Üí Lambda manageable
   - Cloud-native ‚Üí Use managed services

4. **How complex are your computations?**
   - Simple aggregations ‚Üí Stream-only sufficient
   - Complex ML/analytics ‚Üí Lambda beneficial
   - Iterative algorithms ‚Üí Batch layer needed

5. **What's your reprocessing frequency?**
