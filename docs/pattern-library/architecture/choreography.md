# Choreography Pattern

!!! warning "ü•â Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Legacy Event Coordination** ‚Ä¢ Kafka Streaming, Saga Orchestration recommended
    
    Pure choreography creates debugging nightmares in complex workflows. Modern alternatives like Apache Kafka streaming provide event ordering and replay, while saga orchestration offers workflow visibility.
    
    **Migration Path:** Replace with event streaming platforms or explicit workflow orchestration for production systems

## Essential Question

**How do we coordinate distributed workflows without central control while maintaining observability?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Simple linear workflows | User registration ‚Üí Email ‚Üí Welcome message | Easy to track, minimal states |
| Maximum service autonomy | Independent team boundaries | Faster development cycles |
| Event-driven system already | Existing event bus infrastructure | Leverages current architecture |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Complex business workflows | Impossible to debug multi-step failures | Saga orchestration patterns |
| Need workflow visibility | No central place to see process state | Workflow engines (Temporal, Zeebe) |
| Strict ordering requirements | Events can arrive out of order | Event streaming with ordering |
| Regulatory compliance | No audit trail of business processes | Event sourcing + orchestration |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min) {#intuition}

### The Story

Imagine a flash mob where dancers coordinate without a visible choreographer. Each dancer watches for cues from others and responds with their moves. It looks magical when it works, but when someone misses a cue, the entire performance falls apart‚Äîand no one knows who to blame or how to fix it.

### Visual Metaphor
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Choreography Flow"
        A["üé™ Order Service<br/>Creates order"] --> B["üì¶ Inventory Service<br/>Reserves items"]
        B --> C["üí≥ Payment Service<br/>Processes payment"]
        C --> D["üöö Shipping Service<br/>Ships order"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#81c784,stroke:#388e3c
    style D fill:#64b5f6,stroke:#1976d2
```

### Core Insight
> **Key Takeaway:** Choreography trades workflow visibility for service autonomy‚Äîgreat for simple flows, problematic for complex business processes.

### In One Sentence
Choreography coordinates distributed services through event reactions without central control, enabling autonomy but sacrificing observability.

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min) {#foundation}

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without Proper Coordination</h4>

**E-commerce Company, 2019**: Used pure choreography for order processing. During Black Friday, a payment service bug caused orders to get stuck in "pending" state. With no central visibility, it took 6 hours to identify which step failed, losing $3M in sales.

**Impact**: 40% customer satisfaction drop, emergency architecture redesign, 3-month recovery period
</div>

### How It Works

#### Architecture Overview
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Choreography Architecture"
        A[Order Service] --> B[Event Bus]
        C[Inventory Service] --> B
        D[Payment Service] --> B
        E[Shipping Service] --> B
        
        B --> F["Event Reactions<br/>No Central Control"]
    end
    
    classDef primary fill:#5448C8,stroke:#3f33a6,color:#fff
    classDef secondary fill:#00BCD4,stroke:#0097a7,color:#fff
    
    class B primary
    class A,C,D,E secondary
```

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Event Bus** | Message routing | Delivers events to interested services |
| **Services** | Business logic | React to events, publish new events |
| **Event Schema** | Message format | Defines event structure and versioning |

### Basic Example

```python
# Choreography event handling (simplified)
def handle_order_created(event):
    """Shows service reaction to events"""
    # Each service reacts independently
    if event.type == "OrderCreated":
        reserve_inventory(event.order_id)
        publish_event("InventoryReserved", event.order_id)
    elif event.type == "PaymentProcessed":
        create_shipment(event.order_id)
        publish_event("ShipmentCreated", event.order_id)
```

### Implementation Details

#### State Management
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> OrderCreated
    OrderCreated --> InventoryReserved: Service reaction
    OrderCreated --> InventoryFailed: Out of stock
    InventoryReserved --> PaymentProcessed: Service reaction
    InventoryReserved --> PaymentFailed: Card declined
    PaymentProcessed --> OrderShipped: Service reaction
    OrderShipped --> [*]: Success
    InventoryFailed --> OrderCancelled: Compensation
    PaymentFailed --> InventoryReleased: Compensation
    OrderCancelled --> [*]: Failed
```

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Event Ordering** | Strict order<br>Best effort | Consistency vs performance<br>Simple vs complex | Use event streaming for ordering |
| **Failure Handling** | Retry forever<br>Dead letter queue | Reliability vs complexity<br>Automatic vs manual | Implement circuit breakers |
| **Event Schema** | Flexible JSON<br>Strict schema | Evolution vs compatibility<br>Fast vs safe | Use schema registry |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **No event ordering**: Events arrive out of sequence causing invalid states ‚Üí Use message keys or event streaming
2. **Infinite retry loops**: Failed events retry forever consuming resources ‚Üí Implement exponential backoff and dead letter queues
3. **Event schema evolution**: Breaking changes break consumers ‚Üí Use schema registry with compatibility rules
</div>

### Production Considerations

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Range | Optimization Target |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Event Latency | 10-100ms | Minimize event bus overhead |
| Throughput | 10K-1M events/sec | Scale event bus horizontally |
| Memory | Low per service | Stateless event handlers |
| Debugging Time | Hours-Days | Add distributed tracing |

### Advanced Techniques

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Event Sourcing Integration**
   - When to apply: Need complete audit trail and event replay
   - Impact: 100% workflow visibility but 3x storage requirements
   - Trade-off: Perfect debugging vs operational complexity

2. **Saga Pattern Compensation**
   - When to apply: Complex workflows requiring rollback
   - Impact: Reliable error recovery but increased code complexity
   - Trade-off: Business consistency vs development overhead

### Scaling Considerations

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Small Scale (2-5 services)"
        A1["Event Bus<br/>RabbitMQ"]
        A2["Simple Events<br/>JSON messages"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Medium Scale (5-20 services)"
        B1["Apache Kafka<br/>Event Streaming"]
        B2["Schema Registry<br/>Event Evolution"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Large Scale (20+ services)"
        C1["Multi-Region Kafka<br/>Global Event Bus"]
        C2["Event Mesh<br/>Cross-cluster routing"]
    end
    
    A1 -->|"1K events/sec"| B1
    B1 -->|"100K events/sec"| C1
```

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Dashboard Panel |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Event Processing Lag** | > 5 seconds | Event consumer lag by topic |
| **Dead Letter Queue Size** | > 100 messages | Failed event processing rate |
| **Workflow Completion Rate** | < 95% | End-to-end business process success |
| **Event Ordering Violations** | > 0.1% | Out-of-order event detection |

### Real-World Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: Netflix Streaming Pipeline

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° Production Insights from Netflix</h4>

**Challenge**: Process billions of viewing events without central bottlenecks while maintaining user experience

**Implementation**: Event choreography for view tracking, recommendations updates, and content analytics

**Results**: 
- **Scale**: 500B+ events/day processed globally
- **Latency**: Sub-100ms event processing
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with regional failover

**Lessons Learned**: Works well for analytics pipelines but required extensive monitoring infrastructure for debugging
