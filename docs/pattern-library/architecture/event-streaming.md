# Event Streaming

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Real-Time Stream Processing** ‚Ä¢ Specialized for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios
    
    Event streaming enables powerful real-time analytics and event-driven architectures but requires significant expertise in distributed systems. Best for teams with streaming experience handling high-volume, time-sensitive data.
    
    **Best For:** Real-time analytics, IoT processing, financial trading systems, recommendation engines

## Essential Question

**How do we process unbounded streams of real-time events while handling late data, maintaining state, and ensuring exactly-once semantics?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Real-time analytics | Fraud detection, system monitoring | Sub-second insights prevent losses |
| IoT data processing | Smart cities, manufacturing sensors | Continuous processing of sensor streams |
| Event-driven microservices | Service choreography at scale | Loose coupling with high throughput |
| Complex event processing | Trading systems, security monitoring | Pattern detection across event streams |
| Continuous computation | Recommendation engines, personalization | Always-on processing for real-time results |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Simple request-response | No continuous data flow | REST APIs or RPC calls |
| Batch processing sufficient | Hourly/daily processing acceptable | Apache Spark or scheduled ETL |
| Small data volume | < 1000 events/second | Message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS) |
| No real-time requirements | Results can wait hours/days | Batch processing systems |
| Limited expertise | Team lacks streaming experience | Start with simpler message queues |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min) {#intuition}

### The Story

Imagine a security guard monitoring a building with hundreds of cameras. Instead of reviewing footage later (batch), they watch live feeds and react instantly to suspicious activity. Event streaming is like having AI that can watch all feeds simultaneously, detect patterns, and alert immediately.

### Visual Metaphor

**Architecture Components:**
- Service layer
- Processing components
- Data storage
- External integrations


</details>

### Core Insight
> **Key Takeaway:** Stream processing turns data into intelligence in real-time, enabling immediate responses to events as they happen.

### In One Sentence
Event streaming processes infinite sequences of events in real-time, maintaining state and enabling immediate reactions to patterns and anomalies.

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min) {#foundation}

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without Real-Time Processing</h4>

**Financial Services Company, 2020**: Used batch processing to detect fraudulent transactions, running analysis every 4 hours. During a coordinated attack, fraudsters stole $2.3M before the next batch job detected the pattern.

**Impact**: $2.3M direct loss, 3x increase in false positives due to reactive measures, 18-month recovery period
</div>

### How It Works

#### Architecture Overview
#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Stream Ingestion** | Event collection | Reliably capture high-velocity event streams |
| **Processing Engine** | Real-time computation | Apply transformations, aggregations, and logic |
| **State Management** | Memory for streams | Maintain running state for stateful operations |
| **Output Sinks** | Result delivery | Send processed results to downstream systems |

    OutputEmit --> EventArrival: Continue
    StateCheckpoint --> Recovery: System failure
    Recovery --> StateUpdate: Restore from checkpoint
```

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Time Semantics** | Event time<br>Processing time | Accuracy vs simplicity<br>Complex vs fast | Use event time for business logic |
| **State Backend** | In-memory<br>Persistent (RocksDB) | Speed vs durability<br>Fast vs fault-tolerant | Persistent for production systems |
| **Delivery Guarantees** | At-most-once<br>Exactly-once | Performance vs correctness<br>Fast vs accurate | Exactly-once for critical operations |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Ignoring event time**: Using processing time for business logic ‚Üí Always use event time for correctness
2. **No watermark strategy**: Late events cause incorrect results ‚Üí Configure watermarks based on data characteristics
3. **Unbounded state growth**: Memory leaks in stateful operations ‚Üí Implement state TTL and cleanup policies
</div>

### Production Considerations

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Range | Optimization Target |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| Latency | 1-100ms | Minimize processing overhead |
| Throughput | 10K-10M events/sec | Scale processing parallelism |
| State Size | GB-TB per operator | Optimize state access patterns |
| Checkpoint Time | Seconds-Minutes | Balance frequency vs performance |
