## Essential Question
## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |
**How do we structure our system architecture to leverage shared nothing architecture?**


# Shared Nothing Architecture

## üéØ The Essence

!!! tip "Core Concept"
    Each node in the system owns its data and compute exclusively - no shared memory, no shared disk, no shared anything. Communication happens only through the network.


## üîç Intuition: The Restaurant Kitchen Analogy

Imagine two restaurant kitchen designs:

**Shared Kitchen** (Traditional): All chefs share the same stove, refrigerator, and prep stations. They constantly bump into each other, wait for equipment, and coordinate access.

**Station Kitchen** (Shared Nothing): Each chef has their own complete station - stove, ingredients, tools. They work independently and only communicate to pass completed dishes.

The station kitchen scales linearly - add more chefs, get proportionally more output. The shared kitchen hits bottlenecks quickly.

## üìä Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Shared Nothing | Shared Memory | Shared Disk |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Scalability** | Linear (near-perfect) | Limited by memory bus | Limited by disk I/O |
| **Fault Isolation** | Excellent | Poor | Moderate |
| **Complexity** | Higher (coordination) | Lower | Moderate |
| **Cost** | Higher (duplication) | Lower | Moderate |
| **Use Cases** | Web scale systems | HPC, Databases | Traditional databases |

|----------------|---------|------------|
| **Partition Strategy** | Range, Hash, Geographic | Balance vs Locality |
| **Replication** | None, Leader-Follower, Multi-Master | Availability vs Complexity |
| **Consistency** | Eventual, Strong per-partition | Performance vs Guarantees |
| **Routing** | Client-side, Proxy, Gossip | Latency vs Flexibility |

## üåç Real-World Examples

### 1. **Amazon DynamoDB**
- Each node owns specific key ranges
- No shared state between nodes
- Achieves millions of requests/second

### 2. **Google Spanner**
- Sharded by key ranges
- Each shard is independent
- Cross-shard transactions via 2PC

### 3. **Cassandra**
- Ring-based architecture
- Each node owns token ranges
- Peer-to-peer, no single point of failure

## ‚öñÔ∏è When to Use vs Avoid

### ‚úÖ Use When:
- **Horizontal scalability** is critical
- **Workload is partitionable** by some key
- **Independence** between partitions
- **Fault isolation** is important

### ‚ùå Avoid When:
- **Complex joins** across data
- **Global transactions** required
- **Shared state** is fundamental
- **Small scale** (overhead not justified)
