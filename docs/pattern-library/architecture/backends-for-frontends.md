# Backends For Frontends (BFF)

!!! warning "🥈 Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Client-Specific API Optimization** • Best for multi-platform applications
    
    A specialized pattern for creating tailored backend services for different frontend clients. While valuable for complex multi-platform scenarios, it adds operational overhead that may not be justified for simpler applications.

**One API doesn't fit all: Tailored backends for optimal frontend experiences**

> *"The best API is the one designed specifically for its consumer. In a world of diverse clients—mobile, web, TV, voice—one size fits none."*

## Essential Questions for Architects

### 🤔 Key Decision Points

1. **How many different client types do you have?**
   - 1-2 clients → Shared API with client-specific endpoints
   - 3-4 clients → Consider BFF for major platforms
   - 5+ clients → BFF pattern highly recommended

2. **How different are your client requirements?**
   - Similar needs → Single API with query parameters
   - Moderate differences → API Gateway with transformations
   - Vastly different → Dedicated BFFs

3. **Do you have separate frontend teams?**
   - Single team → Shared API may suffice
   - Platform teams → BFF enables independence
   - External teams → BFF provides clear ownership

4. **What's your performance sensitivity?**
   - Low latency critical → BFF for optimal payloads
   - Standard performance → Consider trade-offs
   - Best effort → Shared API acceptable

5. **What's your operational capacity?**
   - Limited ops → Minimize service count
   - Mature ops → BFF complexity manageable
   - Full DevOps → Teams own their BFFs

## Decision Criteria Matrix

| Factor | Use BFF | Use Shared API | Use API Gateway |
|--------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Client Count** | 3+ diverse clients | 1-2 similar clients | 2-3 with minor differences |
| **Team Structure** | Separate platform teams | Single team | Shared backend team |
| **Performance Needs** | Client-specific optimization | Acceptable for all | Some optimization needed |
| **Development Speed** | Fast platform iteration | Coordinated releases | Moderate flexibility |
