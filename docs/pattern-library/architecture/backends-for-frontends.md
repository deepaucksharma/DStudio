# Backends For Frontends (BFF)

!!! warning "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Client-Specific API Optimization** ‚Ä¢ Best for multi-platform applications
    
    A specialized pattern for creating tailored backend services for different frontend clients. While valuable for complex multi-platform scenarios, it adds operational overhead that may not be justified for simpler applications.

**One API doesn't fit all: Tailored backends for optimal frontend experiences**

> *"The best API is the one designed specifically for its consumer. In a world of diverse clients‚Äîmobile, web, TV, voice‚Äîone size fits none."*

## Essential Questions for Architects

### ü§î Key Decision Points

1. **How many different client types do you have?**
   - 1-2 clients ‚Üí Shared API with client-specific endpoints
   - 3-4 clients ‚Üí Consider BFF for major platforms
   - 5+ clients ‚Üí BFF pattern highly recommended

2. **How different are your client requirements?**
   - Similar needs ‚Üí Single API with query parameters
   - Moderate differences ‚Üí API Gateway with transformations
   - Vastly different ‚Üí Dedicated BFFs

3. **Do you have separate frontend teams?**
   - Single team ‚Üí Shared API may suffice
   - Platform teams ‚Üí BFF enables independence
   - External teams ‚Üí BFF provides clear ownership

4. **What's your performance sensitivity?**
   - Low latency critical ‚Üí BFF for optimal payloads
   - Standard performance ‚Üí Consider trade-offs
   - Best effort ‚Üí Shared API acceptable

5. **What's your operational capacity?**
   - Limited ops ‚Üí Minimize service count
   - Mature ops ‚Üí BFF complexity manageable
   - Full DevOps ‚Üí Teams own their BFFs
