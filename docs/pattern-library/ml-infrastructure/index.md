# ML Infrastructure Patterns

## Overview

Machine Learning infrastructure patterns address the unique challenges of building, deploying, and maintaining ML systems at scale. These patterns cover the entire ML lifecycle from data preparation through model serving and monitoring.

## Pattern Categories

### Model Training & Development
- **[Distributed Training](distributed-training.md)** - Scale model training across multiple nodes
- **[Feature Store](feature-store.md)** - Centralized feature management and serving
- **[ML Pipeline Orchestration](ml-pipeline-orchestration.md)** - Coordinate complex ML workflows

### Model Serving & Deployment  
- **[Model Serving at Scale](model-serving-scale.md)** - High-performance model inference
- **[Model Versioning & Rollback](model-versioning-rollback.md)** - Safe model deployment and updates

## Key Challenges Addressed

### Scale & Performance
- Training large models on massive datasets
- Low-latency inference at high throughput
- Resource optimization and cost management

### Reliability & Operations
- Model reproducibility and versioning
- A/B testing and gradual rollouts
- Monitoring model drift and performance

### Data Management
- Feature consistency between training and serving
- Real-time feature computation
- Data lineage and governance

## Common Combinations

These patterns work well together:

### Production ML Platform
1. [Feature Store](feature-store.md) → Manage features
2. [ML Pipeline Orchestration](ml-pipeline-orchestration.md) → Coordinate workflows  
3. [Model Serving at Scale](model-serving-scale.md) → Deploy models
4. [Model Versioning & Rollback](model-versioning-rollback.md) → Manage releases

### Real-Time ML System
1. [Feature Store](feature-store.md) → Online feature serving
2. [Model Serving at Scale](model-serving-scale.md) → Low-latency inference
3. Stream processing → Real-time feature computation

### Scaling Patterns
- [Auto-Scaling](../scaling/auto-scaling.md) - Dynamic model serving capacity
- [Caching Strategies](../scaling/caching-strategies.md) - Feature and prediction caching
- [Load Balancing](../scaling/load-balancing.md) - Distribute inference requests

## Implementation Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Training Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX
- **Orchestration**: Kubeflow, MLflow, Airflow
- **Serving**: TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Triton
- **Feature Stores**: Feast, Tecton, Hopsworks

### Best Practices
1. **Version Everything** - Models, data, features, and code
2. **Monitor Continuously** - Track model performance and drift
3. **Automate Pipelines** - Reduce manual intervention
4. **Test Rigorously** - Validate models before deployment
5. **Plan for Rollback** - Quick recovery from failures

## Case Studies

Real-world implementations:

- **Uber Michelangelo** - End-to-end ML platform
- **Netflix ML Infrastructure** - Personalization at scale
- **Google TFX** - Production ML pipelines
- **Airbnb ML Platform** - Democratizing ML

## Getting Started

1. Start with [Feature Store](feature-store.md) for data management
2. Add [ML Pipeline Orchestration](ml-pipeline-orchestration.md) for workflow automation
3. Implement [Model Serving at Scale](model-serving-scale.md) for production deployment
4. Enable [Model Versioning & Rollback](model-versioning-rollback.md) for safe updates
