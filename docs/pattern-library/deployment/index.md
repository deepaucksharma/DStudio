# Deployment Patterns

Modern deployment patterns enable safe, reliable, and fast software delivery at scale. These patterns minimize downtime, reduce deployment risks, and enable rapid iteration while maintaining system stability.

## Pattern Categories

### Progressive Deployment
- [Blue-Green Deployment](blue-green-deployment.md) - Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback
- [Canary Release](canary-release.md) - Gradual rollout with risk mitigation
- [Progressive Rollout](progressive-rollout.md) - Controlled feature exposure

### Feature Management
- [Feature Flags](feature-flags.md) - Runtime feature control and experimentation
- [Immutable Infrastructure](immutable-infrastructure.md) - Consistent, reliable deployments

## Quick Selection Guide

| Problem | Start With | Then Add |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Zero-downtime deployments | Blue-Green Deployment | Canary Release |
| Risk mitigation | Canary Release | Feature Flags |
| Feature experimentation | Feature Flags | Progressive Rollout |
| Infrastructure consistency | Immutable Infrastructure | Blue-Green Deployment |
| Complex rollouts | Progressive Rollout | Feature Flags |

## Real-World Impact

- **Netflix**: 4000+ daily deployments with <0.01% failure rate
- **Amazon**: 50M+ deployments per year with 11.6 second average rollback
- **Google**: 5500+ releases per day with 99.99% deployment success
- **Facebook**: 1000+ daily deployments with A/B testing integration
