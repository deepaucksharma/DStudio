## ⚡ Quick Decision Rules

1. **Start Simple**: Don't use a pattern unless you feel the pain it solves
2. **Resilience First**: Always add Circuit Breaker before scaling out
3. **Cache Everything**: But know your invalidation strategy
4. **Async When Possible**: Synchronous calls are the enemy of scale
5. **Monitor Before Optimizing**: You can't improve what you don't measure
6. **Design for Failure**: Everything fails, plan for it
7. **Evolutionary Architecture**: Your needs will change, design for change
