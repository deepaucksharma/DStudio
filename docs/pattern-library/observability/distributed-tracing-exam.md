## Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (40 points - 4 points each)

### Question 1: OpenTelemetry Fundamentals
Which of the following best describes OpenTelemetry's role in distributed tracing?

A) A proprietary tracing backend that stores trace data  
B) A vendor-neutral observability framework providing APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation  
C) A specific protocol for transmitting trace data over HTTP  
D) A visualization tool for displaying trace timelines  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral observability framework that provides a collection of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces).

### Question 2: W3C Trace Context
What is the primary purpose of the W3C Trace Context specification?

A) To define the visual representation of traces in UIs  
B) To standardize how trace context is propagated across service boundaries  
C) To specify the storage format for trace data in databases  
D) To define sampling algorithms for trace collection  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: W3C Trace Context standardizes the HTTP headers (`traceparent` and `tracestate`) used to propagate trace context across distributed services, ensuring compatibility between different tracing systems.

### Question 3: B3 Headers vs W3C Trace Context
Which statement accurately compares B3 headers with W3C Trace Context?

A) B3 is newer and always preferred over W3C Trace Context  
B) W3C Trace Context is the industry standard, while B3 is Zipkin-specific legacy  
C) B3 headers use binary encoding, while W3C uses text encoding  
D) Both serve the same purpose but use different header formats and field structures  

**Answer**: D

**Explanation**: Both B3 (`X-B3-TraceId`, `X-B3-SpanId`, etc.) and W3C Trace Context (`traceparent`, `tracestate`) propagate trace context across services but use different header formats. W3C is becoming the preferred standard.

### Question 4: Head-based Sampling
In head-based sampling, the sampling decision is made:

A) After the entire trace is complete and analyzed  
B) At the root span when the trace begins  
C) Randomly at each service boundary  
D) Based on the error rate of the trace  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Head-based sampling makes the sampling decision at the beginning of the trace (at the root span), and this decision is propagated to all child spans in the trace.

### Question 5: Tail-based Sampling Advantage
What is the primary advantage of tail-based sampling over head-based sampling?

A) Lower CPU overhead during trace collection  
B) Simpler implementation and configuration  
C) Ability to make sampling decisions based on complete trace characteristics  
D) Better compatibility with legacy systems  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Tail-based sampling can make more intelligent sampling decisions because it has access to the complete trace, including error rates, latencies, and other characteristics that aren't available at trace start.

### Question 6: Jaeger vs Zipkin Architecture
Which architectural difference distinguishes Jaeger from Zipkin?

A) Jaeger only supports head-based sampling, Zipkin supports both  
B) Jaeger uses a multi-component architecture with separate collector and query services  
C) Zipkin is written in Go, Jaeger is written in Java  
D) Jaeger requires Kafka, Zipkin does not  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Jaeger uses a multi-component architecture with jaeger-agent, jaeger-collector, jaeger-query, and storage backend, while Zipkin typically runs as a single service (though it can be distributed).

### Question 7: Trace Context Propagation Failure
If trace context propagation fails between two services, what happens?

A) The entire trace is discarded and an error is thrown  
B) A new trace is started at the downstream service, breaking the connection  
C) The system automatically retries the request with proper context  
D) All subsequent spans are marked as errors  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: When trace context propagation fails, the downstream service will start a new trace, effectively breaking the trace continuity. This results in disconnected trace segments.

### Question 8: Performance Overhead Mitigation
Which technique is most effective for reducing distributed tracing performance overhead?

A) Increasing the number of spans per trace  
B) Using synchronous span export to collectors  
C) Implementing appropriate sampling strategies  
D) Storing all trace data in memory  

**Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Sampling strategies (head-based, tail-based, or adaptive) are the most effective way to reduce overhead by limiting the number of traces collected and processed.

### Question 9: Span Attributes vs Events
What is the key difference between span attributes and span events?

A) Attributes are mutable, events are immutable  
B) Attributes describe span characteristics, events represent specific moments in time  
C) Events can only be added at span creation, attributes can be added anytime  
D) Attributes use structured data, events use unstructured text  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Span attributes are key-value pairs describing the span (e.g., HTTP method, database query), while events represent timestamped occurrences during the span's lifetime (e.g., cache miss, exception thrown).

### Question 10: Service Map Generation
Service maps in distributed tracing are primarily generated from:

A) Service discovery registry data  
B) Analysis of span relationships and service names  
C) Manual configuration of service topologies  
D) Kubernetes deployment manifests  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Service maps are generated by analyzing the relationships between spans (parent-child relationships) and extracting service names from span metadata to visualize service dependencies.

## Section 2: Scenario-Based Problems (25 points - 5 points each)

### Question 11: High Latency Investigation
**Scenario**: Your e-commerce application shows high P99 latency (2.5s) for checkout requests. The trace shows:
- Frontend → API Gateway: 50ms
- API Gateway → Order Service: 100ms  
- Order Service → Payment Service: 2000ms
- Order Service → Inventory Service: 200ms (parallel)
- Payment Service → External Payment Provider: 1800ms

**Problem**: The payment team claims their service is performing normally (internal processing takes only 50ms). What is the most likely root cause and how would you investigate further?

**Answer**: 
The issue is likely network latency or connection pool exhaustion between the Payment Service and External Payment Provider. The Payment Service internal processing (50ms) is normal, but the total time (1800ms) suggests:

1. **Network issues**: High latency or packet loss to external provider
2. **Connection pool exhaustion**: All connections busy, requests queuing
3. **External provider throttling**: Rate limiting causing delays
4. **DNS resolution issues**: Slow DNS lookups

**Investigation steps**:
1. Check span events for connection establishment times
2. Examine span attributes for HTTP status codes and retry attempts
3. Compare trace data with infrastructure metrics (connection pool size, DNS resolution times)
4. Analyze error rates and timeout patterns in traces
5. Verify external provider SLA and current status

### Question 12: Missing Trace Data
**Scenario**: You notice that traces from your mobile application are incomplete - they start at the API Gateway but don't include any spans from the mobile client. Backend services show normal trace collection rates (95%+), but mobile-originated traces represent only 60% of expected volume.

**Problem**: Identify three potential causes and propose solutions for each.

**Answer**:

**Cause 1: Mobile Network Connectivity Issues**
- Mobile devices may lose connectivity before traces are exported
- *Solution*: Implement offline trace buffering with retry logic and batch export when connectivity is restored

**Cause 2: Mobile App Performance Constraints**
- Tracing overhead may be too high for resource-constrained mobile devices
- *Solution*: Implement adaptive sampling based on device capabilities (battery level, network type) and reduce sampling rate for low-end devices

**Cause 3: Trace Context Not Propagated from Mobile**
- Mobile SDK may not be properly setting trace headers in HTTP requests
- *Solution*: Verify mobile OpenTelemetry SDK configuration, ensure proper header injection, and implement trace context validation at API Gateway

**Additional considerations**:
- App lifecycle issues (traces lost when app backgrounds)
- Platform-specific limitations (iOS/Android background processing restrictions)
- SDK version compatibility issues

### Question 13: Distributed Lock Timeout
**Scenario**: A distributed application uses Redis for distributed locking. Traces show periodic timeouts when acquiring locks, but the Redis team reports normal performance. The trace pattern shows:
- Service A requests lock: 10ms
- Lock acquisition attempt: 5000ms (timeout)
- Lock not acquired, operation fails

**Problem**: The lock timeout is set to 5 seconds, but traces show some lock acquisitions take longer. How would you use tracing data to diagnose and resolve this issue?

**Answer**:

**Diagnosis using tracing data**:
1. **Analyze lock contention patterns**: Group traces by lock key to identify highly contended resources
2. **Examine lock hold times**: Check spans for actual lock hold duration vs. expected duration
3. **Correlate with Redis traces**: Look for Redis command latency spikes during lock timeouts
4. **Check for distributed deadlocks**: Trace multiple services attempting to acquire multiple locks

**Resolution strategy**:
1. **Implement exponential backoff**: Add jitter to reduce thundering herd effects
2. **Add lock queue metrics**: Instrument lock acquisition with custom span attributes (queue_position, wait_time)
3. **Implement lock expiry monitoring**: Add span events when locks are force-expired
4. **Consider lock-free alternatives**: For high-contention scenarios, evaluate optimistic concurrency patterns

**Tracing improvements**:
- Add span attributes for lock key, timeout value, and retry attempts
- Create custom span events for lock acquisition stages (queued, acquired, released)
- Implement correlation between lock holder and lock requester traces

### Question 14: Cascade Failure Analysis
**Scenario**: During Black Friday traffic, your system experiences a cascade failure. Initial traces show:
1. Database connection pool exhaustion in Order Service
2. Increased timeout rates to Order Service
3. Retry storms from upstream services
4. Circuit breaker activations across multiple services

**Problem**: How would you use distributed tracing to build a timeline of the cascade failure and prevent future occurrences?

**Answer**:

**Cascade failure timeline construction**:

1. **Identify Patient Zero**:
   - Filter traces by timestamp around failure start
   - Look for first occurrence of database connection pool exhaustion spans
   - Analyze span attributes for connection pool metrics

2. **Map failure propagation**:
   - Trace retry attempts using span event timestamps
   - Identify circuit breaker state changes through span attributes
   - Correlate timeout patterns across service boundaries

3. **Analyze retry amplification**:
   - Calculate retry ratios from trace data (original requests vs. retry attempts)
   - Identify services contributing to retry storms
   - Map dependency chains showing failure propagation paths

**Prevention strategies based on trace analysis**:

1. **Implement bulkhead patterns**: Isolate critical paths identified in traces
2. **Add adaptive timeouts**: Use trace latency data to set dynamic timeouts
3. **Implement backpressure**: Based on trace volume analysis during overload
4. **Add observability alerts**: Create alerts based on trace patterns (retry rates, error propagation)

**Tracing enhancements**:
- Add circuit breaker state as span attributes
- Include connection pool metrics in database spans
- Implement trace sampling that prioritizes error traces during incidents

### Question 15: Cross-Region Latency
**Scenario**: Your application is deployed across US-East, US-West, and EU regions. Traces show inconsistent cross-region latencies:
- US-East → US-West: 150ms (expected: 70ms)
- US-East → EU: 200ms (expected: 180ms)
- US-West → EU: 400ms (expected: 200ms)

**Problem**: Customer complaints indicate slow performance for West Coast users accessing EU data. How would you use tracing data to optimize the routing and caching strategy?

**Answer**:

**Tracing analysis approach**:

1. **Geographic latency patterns**:
   - Segment traces by client region and destination service region
   - Calculate P50, P95, P99 latencies for each region pair
   - Identify network path inefficiencies from span timing data

2. **Cache effectiveness analysis**:
   - Analyze cache hit/miss ratios from span attributes
   - Identify data that frequently crosses regions uncached
   - Map user request patterns to data locality

3. **Request routing optimization**:
   - Trace request paths to identify suboptimal routing
   - Analyze load balancer decisions through span metadata
   - Identify opportunities for edge caching

**Optimization strategy**:

1. **Implement intelligent routing**:
   - Route read operations to nearest region with data
   - Use trace data to identify frequently accessed data for regional caching

2. **Edge caching optimization**:
   - Deploy CDN/edge caches based on trace access patterns
   - Implement cache warming strategies for frequently accessed cross-region data

3. **Data replication strategy**:
   - Replicate hot data to multiple regions based on trace access patterns
   - Implement eventual consistency for non-critical data

**Monitoring improvements**:
- Add geographic span attributes (client_region, server_region, network_path)
- Include cache performance metrics in relevant spans
- Implement trace-based alerting for cross-region latency SLA violations

## Section 4: Troubleshooting Exercises (6 points - 3 points each)

### Question 19: Production Trace Analysis
**Scenario**: You receive this actual trace data from a production incident:

```json
{
  "traceId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8",
  "spans": [
    {
      "spanId": "span1",
      "operationName": "HTTP GET /api/orders",
      "startTime": 1640995200000,
      "duration": 5000,
      "tags": {
        "http.method": "GET",
        "http.status_code": 200,
        "user.id": "user123"
      },
      "events": []
    },
    {
      "spanId": "span2",
      "parentSpanId": "span1",
      "operationName": "db.query",
      "startTime": 1640995201000,
      "duration": 4500,
      "tags": {
        "db.statement": "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?",
        "db.connection_id": "conn_pool_1_conn_15"
      },
      "events": [
        {
          "timestamp": 1640995202000,
          "name": "connection.wait",
          "attributes": {
            "pool.available": 0,
            "pool.size": 10
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Problem**: Analyze this trace and identify:
1. The root cause of the performance issue
2. The specific metric that indicates the problem
3. Three immediate actions to resolve the issue

**Answer**:

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Primary Issue**: Database connection pool exhaustion
2. **Evidence**: 
   - `pool.available: 0` indicates no available connections
   - `connection.wait` event shows thread blocking on connection acquisition
   - 4.5s database query duration is excessive for a simple SELECT
   - Connection wait started 1s into the request, consumed 90% of total time

**Specific Problem Metrics**:
- **Connection Pool Utilization**: 100% (0 available out of 10)
- **Connection Wait Time**: ~3.5s (4.5s total - ~1s actual query time)
- **Query Duration**: 450% of acceptable baseline (assuming ~1s normal)

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Scale Connection Pool**:
   ```yaml
   database:
     connection_pool:
       max_size: 50  # Increase from 10
       min_idle: 10
       max_wait_time: 2000ms  # Add timeout
   ```

2. **Implement Connection Health Monitoring**:
   ```python
   # Add span attributes for pool health
   span.set_attribute("db.pool.active", pool.active_connections)
   span.set_attribute("db.pool.idle", pool.idle_connections)
   span.set_attribute("db.pool.wait_time_ms", connection_wait_time)
   ```

3. **Add Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
   ```python
   @circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30)
   def query_orders(user_id):
       # Database query logic with connection timeout
       pass
   ```

### Question 20: Cross-Service Error Correlation
**Scenario**: Multiple services are reporting errors, but the relationship isn't clear. You have these trace fragments:

**Service A Trace**:
```json
{
  "traceId": "trace_001",
  "spanId": "span_a1",
  "operationName": "process_payment",
  "duration": 30000,
  "tags": {
    "error": true,
    "http.status_code": 503
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "timestamp": 1640995225000,
      "name": "exception",
      "attributes": {
        "exception.type": "ServiceUnavailableError",
        "exception.message": "Payment service timeout"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Service B Trace**:
```json
{
  "traceId": "trace_002", 
  "spanId": "span_b1",
  "operationName": "validate_card",
  "duration": 29000,
  "tags": {
    "error": true,
    "payment.provider": "external_provider"
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "timestamp": 1640995226000,
      "name": "timeout",
      "attributes": {
        "timeout.duration": "30s",
        "retry.attempt": 3
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Problem**: These traces appear unrelated (different trace IDs) but happened simultaneously. How would you correlate these errors and determine if they're part of the same incident?

**Answer**:

**Error Correlation Strategy**:

1. **Temporal Correlation Analysis**:
   ```python
   # Group errors by time window
   error_window = group_errors_by_time_window(
       traces=all_traces,
       window_size=60,  # 60-second windows
       error_threshold=5  # 5+ errors indicate incident
   )
   
   # Service A error: 1640995225000 (14:00:25)
   # Service B error: 1640995226000 (14:00:26)  
   # Delta: 1 second - highly correlated
   ```

2. **Service Dependency Mapping**:
   ```
   Service A (process_payment) → Service B (validate_card) → External Provider
   
   Error Flow:
   External Provider timeout → Service B timeout → Service A 503 error
   ```

3. **Error Pattern Analysis**:
   - Both errors have ~30s duration (matching timeout configurations)
   - Both involve payment processing workflow
   - Service B shows retry attempts (3), indicating upstream issues
   - Service A shows timeout specifically mentioning "Payment service"

**Root Cause Determination**:

1. **Primary Cause**: External payment provider latency/unavailability
2. **Propagation Path**:
   ```
   External Provider (slow/down) 
   → Service B (validate_card timeout after retries)
   → Service A (payment service unavailable error)
   ```

3. **Evidence Supporting Correlation**:
   - **Timing**: 1-second difference between error events
   - **Duration similarity**: Both ~30s (timeout threshold)
   - **Workflow dependency**: Payment processing chain
   - **Error pattern**: Timeout → Service unavailable

**Incident Resolution Approach**:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Check external payment provider status/SLA
   - Implement fallback payment provider
   - Reduce timeout values to fail faster
   - Add circuit breaker to prevent cascade failures

2. **Monitoring Improvements**:
   ```python
   # Add correlation attributes to spans
   span.set_attribute("incident.correlation_id", generate_correlation_id())
   span.set_attribute("dependency.external_service", "payment_provider")
   span.set_attribute("workflow.name", "payment_processing")
   
   # Cross-service error correlation
   @trace_correlation_decorator
   def external_service_call(service_name, request):
       # Automatically correlate related service calls
       pass
   ```

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement distributed circuit breaker pattern
   - Add external service health check monitoring
   - Create error correlation dashboards
   - Set up proactive alerting for correlated failures

## Section 5: Implementation Challenge (5 points)

### Question 21: Custom Tracer Implementation
**Challenge**: Implement a simple distributed tracing library that supports:
1. Span creation and management
2. Trace context propagation via HTTP headers  
3. Basic sampling (fixed percentage)
4. Span export to console (JSON format)

- Language: Python or JavaScript/TypeScript
- No external tracing libraries (build from scratch)
- Include context propagation between HTTP requests
- Implement at least one sampling strategy
