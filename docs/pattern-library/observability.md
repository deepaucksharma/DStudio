# Observability

!!! info "Pattern Overview"
    **Category**: observability
    **Complexity**: Medium
    **Use Cases**: monitoring, debugging, performance analysis

## Problem

Complex distributed systems are difficult to understand and debug. Traditional monitoring approaches provide insufficient visibility into system behavior, making it hard to identify root causes of issues and optimize performance.

## Solution

Observability provides comprehensive system insights through three pillars: metrics (what happened), logs (detailed context), and traces (request flow). This enables data-driven troubleshooting and optimization.

## Implementation

```python
## Example implementation
class ObservabilityStack:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def execute(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Provides comprehensive system visibility
- Enables faster incident resolution
- Improves data-driven optimization

**Cons:**
- Increases infrastructure overhead
- Requires additional tooling complexity
- May impact storage and processing costs

## When to Use

- When you need complex distributed systems
- For systems that require high reliability requirements
- In scenarios with performance optimization needs
