## Part 1: Foundations & Philosophy
*Duration: 45 minutes*

### 1.1 The Chaos Engineering Mindset (15 minutes)

Chaos engineering represents a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive resilience testing. Instead of waiting for failures to occur in production, we intentionally introduce controlled failures to build confidence in our systems.

#### Core Principles

1. **Build a hypothesis around steady state behavior**
2. **Vary real-world events** 
3. **Run experiments in production**
4. **Automate experiments to run continuously**
5. **Minimize blast radius**

#### The Netflix Origin Story

In 2008, Netflix began migrating from physical data centers to AWS. This transition exposed them to new failure modes:

    B --> E
    C --> F
    D --> G
    E --> H
    F --> I
```

### 1.2 Production-First Philosophy (15 minutes)

The controversial decision to test in production stems from a simple reality: **production environments are unique**.

#### Why Production Testing Matters

| Testing Environment | Limitations | Production Advantages |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Development** | Simple scenarios, no real load | Real traffic patterns, actual dependencies |
| **Staging** | Limited scale, clean data | Full scale, real user behavior |
| **Load Testing** | Synthetic traffic | Organic failure combinations |
| **Production** | Customer risk | Authentic system behavior |

#### Safety-First Approach

```python
class ProductionSafetyFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.safety_checks = [
            HealthyCapacityCheck(min_healthy_instances=3),
            OngoingIncidentCheck(),
            BusinessHoursCheck(),
            BlastRadiusCheck(max_customer_impact=0.01),
            RollbackCapabilityCheck()
        ]
    
    def is_safe_to_proceed(self, experiment):
        for check in self.safety_checks:
            if not check.validate(experiment):
                return False, check.failure_reason
        return True, "All safety checks passed"
    
    def abort_if_unsafe(self, experiment, real_time_metrics):
        if real_time_metrics.customer_impact > experiment.max_impact:
            self.emergency_abort(experiment)
            self.trigger_incident_response()
```

### 1.3 Cultural Transformation (15 minutes)

Successful chaos engineering requires significant cultural change. Teams must embrace failure as a learning opportunity rather than something to be avoided.

#### The Psychological Safety Foundation

**Blameless Post-Mortems**: When chaos experiments reveal issues, the focus must be on system improvements, not individual blame.

**Failure as Learning**: Each discovered weakness is an opportunity to strengthen the system before a real incident occurs.

**Gradual Adoption**: Start with non-critical systems and low-risk experiments to build confidence.

#### Cultural Maturity Model

        B[Blame individuals]
        C[Hide problems]

## Part 2: Production Practices Deep Dive
*Duration: 75 minutes*

### 2.1 Netflix's Chaos Monkey Evolution (20 minutes)

Netflix pioneered chaos engineering with Chaos Monkey in 2011, evolving it into a comprehensive platform.

#### Chaos Monkey (2011-2013)
The original tool randomly terminated EC2 instances during business hours.

```python
class ChaosMonkey:
    """Original Chaos Monkey concept"""
    
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.enabled = config.chaos_enabled
        self.probability = config.termination_probability  # 1/10000
        self.business_hours_only = True
        self.excluded_services = ["payment-service", "user-auth"]
    
    def run_daily_chaos(self):
        if not self._is_business_hours():
            return
            
        eligible_instances = self.get_eligible_instances()
        for instance in eligible_instances:
            if random.random() < self.probability:
                self.terminate_with_monitoring(instance)
    
    def terminate_with_monitoring(self, instance):
        # Pre-termination snapshot
        metrics_snapshot = self.capture_metrics(instance)
        
        # Terminate instance
        self.aws.terminate_instance(instance.id)
        
        # Monitor recovery
        self.monitor_service_recovery(instance.service, metrics_snapshot)
```

#### The Simian Army (2013-2015)
Netflix expanded beyond instance termination with specialized tools:

**Chaos Gorilla**: Simulates availability zone failures
```yaml
chaos_gorilla:
  target: availability-zone
  frequency: weekly
  duration: 30m
  safety_checks:
    - minimum_healthy_zones: 2
    - no_ongoing_deployments: true
    - customer_impact_threshold: 1%
```

**Chaos Kong**: Tests entire region failures
```yaml
chaos_kong:
  target: aws-region
  frequency: quarterly
  duration: 4h
  safety_checks:
    - minimum_healthy_regions: 2
    - leadership_approval: required
    - customer_impact_threshold: 5%
```

#### Modern ChAP Platform (2015-2025)
Netflix's current Chaos Platform (ChAP) represents the state-of-the-art in chaos engineering.

```python
class ChaosPlatform:
    """Netflix's modern chaos platform"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.experiment_scheduler = ExperimentScheduler()
        self.blast_radius_controller = BlastRadiusController()
        self.ml_predictor = FailurePredictor()
        self.safety_framework = SafetyFramework()
    
    async def execute_experiment(self, experiment_config):
        # AI-driven risk assessment
        risk_score = await self.ml_predictor.assess_risk(experiment_config)
        
        if risk_score > experiment_config.risk_threshold:
            return ExperimentResult.SKIPPED_HIGH_RISK
        
        # Dynamic blast radius calculation
        blast_radius = self.blast_radius_controller.calculate_safe_radius(
            experiment_config
        )
        
        # Execute with real-time monitoring
        return await self._execute_with_monitoring(
            experiment_config, blast_radius
        )
```

## Practical Exercises
*Duration: 45 minutes*

### Exercise 1: Basic Chaos Experiment Design (15 minutes)

**Scenario**: You're running an e-commerce platform with the following services:
- Frontend (React SPA)
- API Gateway  
- User Service
- Product Service
- Order Service
- Payment Service
- Inventory Service
- PostgreSQL Database
- Redis Cache

**Task**: Design your first chaos experiment focusing on database connection failures.

**Template**:
```yaml
experiment_design:
  name: "database-connection-chaos"
  
  hypothesis: |
    # Write your hypothesis here
    
  target:
    service: # Which service to target?
    failure_type: # What failure to inject?
    
  success_criteria:
    - metric: # What metric to measure?
      threshold: # What's acceptable?
      
  safety_controls:
    max_customer_impact: # What's your limit?
    blast_radius:
      max_instances: # How many instances?
      
  rollback_plan:
    # How will you recover?
```

    The Order Service will gracefully handle database connection failures
    by implementing connection pooling retries and fallback to read replicas,
    maintaining <5% error rate and <2s response time degradation

### Exercise 3: Safety Framework Implementation (15 minutes)

**Task**: Implement safety controls for the chaos experiment you designed in Exercise 1.

**Requirements**:
- Real-time monitoring
- Automatic abort conditions
- Blast radius limits
- Rollback procedures

**Code Template**:
```python
class ChaosExperimentSafetyFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your safety components
        pass
    
    def validate_safety_preconditions(self, experiment):
        # Check if it's safe to start the experiment
        pass
    
    def monitor_experiment_safety(self, experiment):
        # Monitor experiment in real-time
        pass
    
    def should_abort_experiment(self, experiment, current_metrics):
        # Determine if experiment should be aborted
        pass
    
    def emergency_rollback(self, experiment):
        # Perform emergency rollback
        pass
```

**Implementation Challenge**:
Implement the safety framework with specific abort conditions based on your experiment design.

## Assessment & Certification
*Duration: 15 minutes*

### Chaos Engineering Mastery Assessment

#### Scenario-Based Questions

**Question 1**: You're implementing chaos engineering at a financial services company. The leadership is concerned about customer impact. How would you structure your chaos engineering program to gain leadership buy-in while maintaining safety?

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

**Approach**:
1. **Start in non-production**: Begin with staging environments to demonstrate value
2. **Minimal blast radius**: Limit initial experiments to <0.1% customer impact
3. **Business hours only**: Run experiments when full teams are available
4. **Gradual expansion**: Prove success before expanding scope
5. **Clear ROI metrics**: Track prevented incidents and MTTR improvements
6. **Leadership involvement**: Include leadership in Game Day exercises
7. **Comprehensive safety**: Multiple layers of automated safety controls
</details>

**Question 2**: During a chaos experiment, you notice error rates increasing beyond acceptable thresholds, but the automatic abort hasn't triggered yet. What should you do?

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Manual abort**: Don't wait for automatic abort - abort manually immediately
2. **Emergency rollback**: Execute rollback procedures to restore service
3. **Incident response**: Follow standard incident response procedures
4. **Root cause analysis**: Investigate why automatic abort didn't trigger
5. **Safety framework improvement**: Update abort conditions based on learnings
