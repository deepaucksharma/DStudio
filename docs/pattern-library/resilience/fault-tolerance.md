# Fault Tolerance Pattern

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Keep systems running despite failures** ‚Ä¢ Foundation for high-availability architectures
    
    Comprehensive approach to building resilient systems through redundancy, isolation, and recovery. While essential for critical systems, the cost and complexity require careful consideration.
    
    **Best For:** Financial systems, healthcare platforms, critical infrastructure

## Essential Question

**How do we build systems that continue operating correctly even when components fail?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Mission-critical systems | Payment processing | Zero downtime requirement |
| Life safety systems | Medical devices, aviation | Failure means danger |
| High-value transactions | Trading platforms | Each second costs money |
| Regulatory compliance | Banking systems | Uptime SLAs required |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Prototypes/MVPs | Over-engineering | Simple error handling |
| Read-only systems | Lower risk | Basic retry logic |
| Batch processing | Can restart | Checkpoint/resume |
| Cost-sensitive apps | Expensive redundancy | Best-effort approach |

### The Airplane Engine Analogy

### Core Insight
> **Key Takeaway:** Fault tolerance = Redundancy + Isolation + Detection + Recovery. No single failure should take down the system.

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min) {#foundation}

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without Fault Tolerance</h4>

**Knight Capital, 2012**: A single faulty software deployment caused uncontrolled trading. In 45 minutes, the company lost $440 million due to no fault isolation or circuit breakers.

**Impact**: Company nearly bankrupt, acquired at fraction of value, industry-wide regulatory changes
</div>

### Fault Tolerance Building Blocks

### Redundancy Models Comparison

| Model | Setup | Availability | Cost | Use Case |
|-------|-------|--------------|------|----------|
| **Active-Active** | Both process requests | 99.99% | 2x | Zero downtime required |
| **Active-Passive** | Standby ready | 99.9% | 1.5x | Cost-conscious HA |
| **N+1** | 1 spare for N units | 99.5% | 1.2x | Hardware redundancy |
| **N+M** | M spares for N units | 99.95% | 1.3x | Large clusters |

### Fault Detection & Response Matrix

#
## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Baseline | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Latency** | 100ms | 20ms | 80% |
| **Throughput** | 1K/s | 10K/s | 10x |
| **Memory** | 1GB | 500MB | 50% |
| **CPU** | 80% | 40% | 50% |

## Implementation Strategies

| Strategy | Detection Time | Recovery Time | Data Loss | Complexity |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Heartbeat + Restart** | 10-30s | 1-5 min | Possible | Low |
| **State Replication** | 1-5s | < 30s | Minimal | Medium |
| **Event Sourcing** | Real-time | < 10s | None | High |
| **Consensus (Raft)** | < 1s | < 5s | None | Very High |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Cascade failures**: One failure triggers another ‚Üí Use circuit breakers between components
2. **Split-brain**: Multiple masters during partition ‚Üí Implement proper quorum/fencing
3. **Retry storms**: Aggressive retries overwhelm ‚Üí Exponential backoff with jitter
4. **Silent failures**: Errors hidden/ignored ‚Üí Fail fast with clear error propagation

### Multi-Layer Fault Tolerance Architecture

### Fault Tolerance Patterns Stack

| Layer | Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Request** | Retry + Timeout | Handle transient failures | 3 retries with exponential backoff |
| **Circuit** | Circuit Breaker | Prevent cascade failures | Open after 5 failures in 10s |
| **Resource** | Bulkhead | Isolate resources | Separate thread pools per service |
| **Data** | Replication | Prevent data loss | Master-slave with <1s lag |
| **Service** | Health Checks | Detect failures | HTTP /health every 10s |

### Advanced Recovery Strategies

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Complexity** | 4 | Complex redundancy architecture, failure detection, and recovery mechanisms |
| **Performance Impact** | 3 | Redundancy adds overhead but prevents catastrophic failures |
| **Operational Overhead** | 4 | Significant operational complexity with monitoring, testing, and maintenance |
| **Team Expertise Required** | 4 | Deep understanding of failure modes, redundancy patterns, and recovery procedures |
| **Scalability** | 4 | Scales well with proper architecture but costs increase with redundancy requirements |

**Overall Recommendation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **USE WITH EXPERTISE** - Critical for mission-critical systems but requires significant investment in complexity and operational discipline.

### Real-World Case Studies

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° Netflix's Fault Tolerance Architecture</h4>

**Challenge**: Maintain streaming during any failure scenario

**Implementation**: 
- Hystrix circuit breakers on every service call
- Regional failover with <1 minute switchover
- Chaos Monkey randomly killing instances
- Fallback to cached content during outages

**Results**: 
- 99.99% availability globally
- Survived entire AWS region failures
- Reduced incident impact by 90%
- Built culture of resilience

**Key Learning**: Test fault tolerance continuously - "The best way to avoid failure is to fail constantly"

|----------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Single Instance** | None | 99% | $100 | $100 |
| **Active-Passive** | 2x | 99.9% | $150 | $50 |
| **Active-Active** | 2x | 99.99% | $200 | $20 |
| **Multi-Region** | 3x | 99.999% | $300 | $10 |
