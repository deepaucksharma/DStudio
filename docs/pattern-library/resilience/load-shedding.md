# Load Shedding Pattern

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Drop wisely to survive** ‚Ä¢ Essential for high-scale systems
    
    Load shedding prevents system collapse by intelligently rejecting requests when approaching capacity. Used by every major internet service during traffic spikes. The key is choosing what to drop.
    
    **Best For:** API gateways, web services, streaming platforms

## Essential Question

**How do we maintain system stability by selectively dropping requests when approaching capacity limits?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Traffic spikes | Black Friday sales | Protect checkout flow |
| DDoS attacks | Malicious traffic | Maintain legitimate service |
| Resource constraints | Database overload | Prevent cascade failure |
| Multi-tenant systems | SaaS platforms | Fair resource allocation |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Unlimited resources | Can scale infinitely | Auto-scaling |
| All requests equal | No prioritization possible | Round-robin limiting |
| Batch processing | No real-time pressure | Queue with backpressure |
| Fixed user base | Predictable load | Capacity planning |

### Core Insight
> **Key Takeaway:** Better to serve some requests well than all requests poorly. Strategic rejection preserves system stability.

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without Load Shedding</h4>

**Facebook, 2010**: Like button launch caused cascade failure. Without load shedding, memcached exhaustion led to database overload, taking down the entire site for hours.

**Impact**: Site-wide outage, millions of users affected, emergency all-hands response required
</div>

### Load Shedding Strategies

### Priority Classification

| Priority | Examples | Accept Until | Business Impact |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Payments, Login | 95% load | Revenue, Access |
| **High** | Checkout, Search | 80% load | Conversion |
| **Normal** | Browse, View | 60% load | Engagement |
| **Low** | Analytics, Logs | 40% load | Insights |

## Level 3: Deep Dive (15 min) {#deep-dive}

### Load Shedding Implementation

### Advanced Shedding Algorithms

| Algorithm | How it Works | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|--------------|------|------|
| **Adaptive Random** | Increase drop % with load | Simple, fair | No business logic |
| **Weighted Fair Queue** | Priority √ó wait time | Prevents starvation | Complex |
| **Cost-Based** | Drop by resource cost | Optimizes throughput | Needs cost model |
| **Predictive** | ML-based prediction | Proactive | Training required |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Binary shedding**: All or nothing ‚Üí Implement gradual shedding levels
2. **No client feedback**: Silent drops ‚Üí Return proper 503 + Retry-After
3. **Poor prioritization**: Wrong priorities ‚Üí Align with business value
4. **Shedding too late**: Already overloaded ‚Üí Start early (60-70% load)

    def update_shed_ratio(self, current_latency):
        # Gradient descent to find optimal shed ratio
        error = current_latency - self.target_latency
        self.shed_ratio += self.alpha * error / self.target_latency
        self.shed_ratio = max(0, min(1, self.shed_ratio))
        
    def should_accept(self, priority_score):
        # Higher priority score = more likely to accept
        threshold = 1 - self.shed_ratio
        return random.random() * priority_score > threshold

### Load Shedding Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Shed Rate** | Shed / Total | < 5% | > 10% |
| **Priority Distribution** | By tier % | Follows plan | Deviation > 20% |
| **Goodput** | Successful / Total | > 95% | < 90% |
| **Revenue Impact** | Lost revenue/hour | Minimize | > $1000/hour |

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Complexity** | 4 | Requires request classification, priority scoring, and adaptive shedding algorithms |
| **Performance Impact** | 4 | Maintains system stability under load but some requests are rejected |
| **Operational Overhead** | 3 | Needs monitoring of shed rates, priority distribution, and business impact |
| **Team Expertise Required** | 3 | Understanding of priority systems, load patterns, and business value mapping |
| **Scalability** | 5 | Excellent for maintaining system stability as load increases |

**Overall Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED** - Essential for high-traffic systems to prevent cascade failures and maintain service quality.

### Real-World Case Studies

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° Google Search Load Shedding</h4>

**Challenge**: Handle 100K+ QPS with consistent <100ms latency

**Implementation**: 
- Multi-tier shedding: Edge ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Backend
- Feature degradation: Disable spell check, instant results
- Priority scoring: Query type + user history
- Adaptive thresholds based on datacenter load

**Results**: 
- 99.9% availability during 10x traffic spikes
- <1% of queries fully shed
- 50ms p99 latency maintained
- Graceful degradation invisible to most users

**Key Learning**: Shed features, not requests - most users prefer fast basic results over slow full results
</div>

### Business-Aware Shedding

| Request Type | Business Value | Priority Score | Shedding Strategy |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Checkout** | $100/request | 1.0 | Never shed |
| **Add to Cart** | $10/request | 0.8 | Shed at 90% load |
| **Search** | $1/request | 0.5 | Degrade features |
| **Browse** | $0.1/request | 0.3 | Aggressive shedding |
| **Analytics** | $0.01/request | 0.1 | First to shed |
