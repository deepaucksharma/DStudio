# Actor Model

!!! warning "ü•â Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Legacy concurrency model - Consider modern alternatives** ‚Ä¢ Modern patterns provide better solutions
    
    While the Actor Model pioneered important concurrency concepts, service mesh, serverless, and event-driven architectures provide better solutions for most use cases. The complexity without clear benefits makes it unsuitable for new projects.
    
    **Migration Path:** See [Service Mesh](../architecture/service-mesh.md) or [Event-Driven Architecture](../../pattern-library/architecture/event-driven.md) for current best practices

## Essential Question

**How do we handle millions of concurrent entities without shared state complexity?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Erlang/Elixir Systems** | Existing BEAM VM infrastructure | Leverage ecosystem strengths |
| **Massive Entity Simulation** | IoT device simulation with millions of entities | Natural entity-per-actor mapping |
| **Telecoms/Messaging** | WhatsApp-style messaging systems | Proven at massive scale |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Microservices** | Service mesh provides better patterns | [Service Mesh](../architecture/service-mesh.md) |
| **Serverless Workloads** | Functions are simpler isolated units | [Serverless Functions](../scaling/serverless.md) |
| **Event Processing** | Stream processing is more efficient | [Event-Driven Architecture](../../pattern-library/architecture/event-driven.md) |
| **Simple CRUD** | Over-engineered for basic operations | Traditional REST APIs |
| **Team Learning** | Steep learning curve without clear benefits | Start with proven patterns |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min) {#intuition}

### The Story

Imagine a massive office building where employees never share documents or talk face-to-face. Instead, they only communicate by sending memos through pneumatic tubes. Each employee works independently in their office, processes memos one at a time, and can send memos to any other employee. If someone quits, their supervisor hires a replacement instantly.

### Visual Metaphor

### Core Insight

> **Key Takeaway:** The Actor Model eliminates shared state complexity by making everything a message-passing entity, but modern patterns achieve the same goals with less complexity.

### In One Sentence

The Actor Model handles concurrency by creating isolated entities that communicate only through asynchronous messages, providing fault tolerance through supervision hierarchies.

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min) {#foundation}

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without Isolation</h4>

**Traditional Threading, 2020**: E-commerce platform using shared state for inventory management experienced race conditions during Black Friday. Multiple threads updating inventory counters led to overselling products.

**Impact**: 15% of orders oversold, $2M in losses from order cancellations and expedited shipping costs to fulfill promises.
</div>

### How It Works

#### Actor System Architecture

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Actor** | Isolated processing unit | Maintain state, process messages sequentially |
| **Mailbox** | Message queue | Store incoming messages, enforce ordering |
| **Supervisor** | Fault management | Monitor children, restart on failure |
| **Message** | Communication unit | Immutable data passed between actors |

### Basic Example

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component2 {
        +process() void
        +validate() bool
        -state: State
    }
    class Handler2 {
        +handle() Result
        +configure() void
    }
    Component2 --> Handler2 : uses
    
    note for Component2 "Core processing logic"
```

# Conceptual actor implementation
class Actor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mailbox = Queue()
        self.state = {}
        
    def send(self, message):
        """Non-blocking message send"""
        self.mailbox.put(message)
        
    def receive(self):
        """Process one message"""
        message = self.mailbox.get()
        self.handle_message(message)

### Implementation Details

#### Message Flow Patterns

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Mailbox Type** | Bounded<br>Unbounded | Bounded: Memory safe, backpressure<br>Unbounded: Risk of OOM | Bounded with overflow strategy |
| **Message Ordering** | FIFO<br>Priority | FIFO: Simple, fair<br>Priority: Complex but flexible | FIFO unless priority needed |
| **Supervision Strategy** | One-for-One<br>All-for-One | One: Isolated failures<br>All: Consistent state | One-for-One for independence |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Blocking Operations**: Never block message processing ‚Üí Use separate actors for I/O
2. **Large Messages**: Avoid copying big data ‚Üí Send references or use streaming
3. **Synchronous Patterns**: Don't wait for replies ‚Üí Embrace async messaging
</div>

### Production Considerations

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Range | Optimization Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Message Latency | 1-100 Œºs | < 10 Œºs for local actors |
| Throughput | 1M-50M msgs/sec | Depends on message complexity |
| Memory per Actor | 300B-2KB | Minimize state size |
| Actor Creation | 1M actors/sec | Pool reuse for short-lived actors |

## Level 4: Expert (20 min) {#expert}

### Advanced Techniques

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Actor Pooling**
   - When to apply: High actor churn scenarios
   - Impact: 10x reduction in allocation overhead
   - Trade-off: More complex lifecycle management

2. **Message Batching**
   - When to apply: High message volume with processing overhead
   - Impact: 3-5x throughput improvement
   - Trade-off: Increased latency for individual messages

### Scaling Considerations

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Dashboard Panel |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Mailbox Depth | > 10,000 messages | Histogram with P95/P99 |
| Message Processing Time | > 100ms P95 | Time series by actor type |
| Actor Restart Rate | > 10 restarts/min | Counter with cause breakdown |
| Memory per Actor | > 10KB average | Memory usage distribution |

### Real-World Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: WhatsApp at Scale

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° Production Insights from WhatsApp</h4>

**Challenge**: Handle 2 million concurrent connections per server with 99.999% uptime

**Implementation**: 
- One Erlang actor per user session
- Supervision trees for automatic recovery
- Hot code deployment without downtime

**Results**: 
- **Concurrent Users**: 2M connections/server
- **Uptime**: 99.999% availability
- **Staff Efficiency**: 50 engineers supporting 900M users

**Lessons Learned**: Actor model excels when each entity has natural state isolation and the platform (BEAM VM) is designed for it.

### Pattern Combinations

#### Works Well With

| Pattern | Combination Benefit | Integration Point |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| [Event Sourcing](../../pattern-library/data-management/event-sourcing.md) | Actors naturally emit events | Actor state changes ‚Üí events |
| [CQRS](../architecture/cqrs.md) | Actors handle commands | Command actors + query services |
