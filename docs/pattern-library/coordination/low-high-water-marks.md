## Essential Question
## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |
**How do we coordinate distributed components effectively using low-water/high-water marks?**


# Low-Water/High-Water Marks

**Flow control boundaries for distributed systems**

> *"Like a river between its banks, data flows best when contained by well-defined boundaries."*

## Level 1: Intuition

### The Dam Analogy

Low and high water marks work like a dam system:
- **High-water mark**: When water reaches this level, open the gates (stop accepting)
- **Low-water mark**: When water drops to this level, close the gates (start accepting)
- **Buffer zone**: The space between prevents rapid on/off switching
- **Overflow protection**: Prevents system flooding

This pattern prevents resource exhaustion while maintaining smooth operation.

### Core Applications

| Use Case | Low Mark | High Mark | Purpose |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **TCP Flow Control** | 25% buffer | 75% buffer | Prevent packet loss |
| **Replication Lag** | 100 txns behind | 1000 txns behind | Control follower lag |
| **Message Queue** | 1K messages | 10K messages | Prevent memory exhaustion |
| **Thread Pool** | 20% utilized | 80% utilized | Scale workers |
| **Disk Usage** | 50% full | 90% full | Trigger cleanup |

### Theoretical Foundations

Water marks implement hysteresis to prevent oscillation:

### Future Directions

1. **ML-Driven Water Marks**: Predict optimal thresholds using historical patterns
2. **Coordinated Water Marks**: Distributed agreement on flow control across cluster
3. **Application-Aware Marks**: Different thresholds based on request priority/type
4. **Economic Water Marks**: Adjust based on cost models and business impact

|-------------|----------|-----------|-----|-------|
| **High-throughput** | 60% | 90% | 30% | Maximize utilization |
| **Low-latency** | 30% | 70% | 40% | Early backpressure |
| **Bursty traffic** | 20% | 80% | 60% | Large buffer zone |
| **Critical systems** | 40% | 60% | 20% | Conservative |

## Decision Matrix

### Quick Decision Table

| Factor | Low Complexity | Medium Complexity | High Complexity |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Team Size | < 5 developers | 5-20 developers | > 20 developers |
| Traffic | < 1K req/s | 1K-100K req/s | > 100K req/s |
| Data Volume | < 1GB | 1GB-1TB | > 1TB |
| **Recommendation** | ‚ùå Avoid | ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider | ‚úÖ Implement |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define capacity limits
- [ ] Set appropriate thresholds
- [ ] Implement hysteresis gap
- [ ] Add monitoring/metrics
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Handle threshold crossing atomically
- [ ] Document behavior
- [ ] Plan for adjustment strategy

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Gap too small**: Rapid state changes (thrashing)
2. **Gap too large**: Poor resource utilization
3. **Static thresholds**: Don't adapt to changing conditions
4. **No monitoring**: Can't detect problems
5. **Binary response**: Should consider gradual throttling
