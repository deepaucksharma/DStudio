# Vector Clocks

!!! info "Pattern Overview"
    **Category**: coordination  
    **Complexity**: Medium  
    **Use Cases**: distributed systems, causality tracking, conflict resolution

## Problem

In distributed systems without global time, determining the causal relationship between events is challenging. Simple timestamps cannot capture concurrent events or causality across different nodes.

## Solution

Vector clocks assign each node a logical clock vector, incrementing local time on events and updating vector on message exchange. This captures causal relationships and enables detection of concurrent events.

## Implementation

```python
# Example implementation
class VectorClock:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Provides causal ordering detection
- Enables conflict-free merging
- Improves concurrent event identification

**Cons:**
- Increases storage overhead per event
- Requires complexity in large systems
- May impact vector size growth

## When to Use

- When you need distributed databases
- For systems that require collaborative editing
- In scenarios with event sourcing systems
