# CAS (Compare-and-Swap)

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Lock-free power with complexity** ‚Ä¢ Use for specific performance-critical needs
    
    CAS enables lock-free programming but comes with significant complexity. The ABA problem and debugging challenges mean traditional locks are often the better choice unless you have specific performance requirements and expertise.
    
    **Best For:** High-performance counters, specialized concurrent data structures where contention is moderate

## Essential Question

**How do we achieve thread-safe updates without locks and their overhead?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **High-Performance Counters** | Metrics collection with millions of increments/sec | 10x faster than mutex-based counters |
| **Low-Contention Updates** | Configuration flags, status fields | Minimal retry loops, predictable performance |
| **Lock-Free Data Structures** | Concurrent stacks, queues for specialized use cases | Eliminate blocking, improve scalability |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **High Contention** | Causes livelock and performance degradation | [Locks with backoff](../coordination/distributed-lock.md) |
| **Complex Operations** | Multi-step updates can't be atomic | [Transactional Memory](../coordination/stm.md) |
| **Team Inexperience** | Subtle bugs are hard to debug | Traditional synchronization primitives |
| **General Purpose** | Locks provide better guarantees | Standard mutex/semaphore patterns |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min) {#intuition}

### The Story

Imagine updating a shared scoreboard at a sports stadium. The traditional approach requires locking the entire board, making your change, then unlocking it - causing everyone else to wait. CAS is like having a magic marker that only works if the current score matches what you expect. If someone else changed it while you were calculating, your marker won't write, and you need to check the new score and try again.

### Visual Metaphor

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "CAS Operation"
        A[Read Value: 10] --> B{Compare: 10 == 10?}
        B -->|Yes| C[Swap to 15]
        B -->|No| D[Retry with new value]
        C --> E[Success]
        D --> A
    end
    
    subgraph "Lock-based"
        F[Acquire Lock] --> G[Read & Modify]
        G --> H[Release Lock]
        I[Other threads wait] -.-> F
    end
    
    style C fill:#81c784,stroke:#388e3c
    style E fill:#64b5f6,stroke:#1976d2
    style I fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#d32f2f
```

### Core Insight

> **Key Takeaway:** CAS trades the guaranteed success of locks for optimistic, retry-based operations that avoid blocking but require careful handling of failures.

### In One Sentence

CAS atomically checks if a memory location contains an expected value and updates it to a new value, returning success/failure without blocking other threads.

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min) {#foundation}

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens With Lock Contention</h4>

**High-Frequency Trading System, 2021**: Order processing system used mutex-protected counters for tracking. Under peak load, lock contention caused 95th percentile latency to spike from 50Œºs to 15ms.

**Impact**: 12% reduction in successful trades, $8M daily revenue loss during market volatility periods when low latency was critical.
</div>

### How It Works

#### CAS Operation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T1 as Thread 1
    participant T2 as Thread 2
    participant M as Memory Location
    
    Note over M: Initial value: 100
    
    T1->>M: Read value (100)
    T2->>M: Read value (100)
    
    Note over T1: Calculate new value: 105
    Note over T2: Calculate new value: 110
    
    T1->>M: CAS(expected: 100, new: 105)
    Note over M: 100 == 100 ‚úì, set to 105
    M-->>T1: Success ‚úÖ
    
    T2->>M: CAS(expected: 100, new: 110)
    Note over M: 105 != 100 ‚úó
    M-->>T2: Failure ‚ùå
    
    T2->>M: Read new value (105)
    Note over T2: Recalculate: 105 + 10 = 115
    T2->>M: CAS(expected: 105, new: 115)
    M-->>T2: Success ‚úÖ
```

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Expected Value** | Consistency check | Ensure no intermediate changes occurred |
| **New Value** | Update target | Value to store if comparison succeeds |
| **Return Status** | Operation result | Indicate success/failure for retry logic |
| **Memory Ordering** | Synchronization | Ensure proper visibility across threads |

### Basic Example

```cpp
// Simple CAS-based counter
class AtomicCounter {
    std::atomic<int> value{0};
    
public:
    int increment() {
        int current = value.load();
        int next;
        do {
            next = current + 1;
        } while (!value.compare_exchange_weak(current, next));
        return next;
    }
};
```

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Memory Ordering** | Relaxed<br>Acquire-Release<br>Sequential | Relaxed: Faster, complex reasoning<br>Seq: Slower, easier reasoning | Acquire-Release for most cases |
| **Retry Strategy** | Immediate<br>Backoff<br>Yield | Immediate: Livelock risk<br>Backoff: Better under contention | Exponential backoff |
| **Failure Handling** | Loop until success<br>Limited retries | Loop: Guaranteed progress<br>Limited: Bounded latency | Context-dependent choice |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **ABA Problem**: Value changes A‚ÜíB‚ÜíA between read and CAS ‚Üí Use versioned references
2. **Livelock**: High contention causes infinite retries ‚Üí Implement exponential backoff
3. **Memory Ordering**: Wrong synchronization semantics ‚Üí Use acquire-release semantics

### Advanced Techniques

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Hazard Pointers for Memory Safety**
   - When to apply: Lock-free data structures with pointers
   - Impact: Safe memory reclamation without garbage collection
   - Trade-off: Additional complexity and memory overhead

2. **Tagged Pointers (ABA Solution)**
   - When to apply: Pointer-based data structures
   - Impact: Eliminates ABA problem completely
   - Trade-off: Requires extra bits for version tags
