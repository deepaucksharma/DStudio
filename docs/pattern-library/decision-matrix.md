# Pattern Decision Matrix

**Essential Question**: *How do I choose the optimal patterns for my distributed system based on latency requirements, consistency needs, scale, and fault tolerance requirements?*

> **What You'll Master**: A systematic approach to pattern selection based on quantified requirements, avoiding over-engineering while ensuring you meet your actual needs.

## The Complete Decision Framework

Choosing the right patterns is like designing a building - you need to understand the load requirements, environmental conditions, budget constraints, and intended use before selecting materials and structural approaches. This matrix provides a quantified, systematic approach to pattern selection based on four critical dimensions: **latency requirements** (how fast must responses be), **consistency needs** (how coordinated must your data be), **scale demands** (how many users/requests/data), and **fault tolerance** requirements (how much downtime can you accept). Each dimension has measurable thresholds that guide you toward appropriate patterns, preventing both under-engineering (system fails to meet requirements) and over-engineering (unnecessary complexity and cost).

## 🎯 Quick Scenario Decision Tree

### Step 1: Primary Constraint Assessment

**Answer these questions to identify your primary constraint:**

| Question | Score | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Latency**: What's your P99 latency requirement? | < 1ms = 4, < 10ms = 3, < 100ms = 2, < 1s = 1, > 1s = 0 | Higher scores require real-time patterns |
| **Consistency**: How critical is data consistency? | ACID required = 4, Strong = 3, Session = 2, Eventual = 1, None = 0 | Higher scores require coordination patterns |
| **Scale**: Peak requests per second? | > 1M = 4, > 100K = 3, > 10K = 2, > 1K = 1, < 1K = 0 | Higher scores require scaling patterns |
| **Availability**: Acceptable downtime per year? | < 5 min = 4, < 1 hour = 3, < 8 hours = 2, < 1 day = 1, > 1 day = 0 | Higher scores require resilience patterns |

**Your Primary Focus**: Highest scoring dimension determines your primary pattern category.

### Decision Validation Checklist

Before implementing any pattern, verify:

- [ ] **Requirement Validated**: Is this requirement real or assumed?
- [ ] **Measurement Planned**: How will you measure success?
- [ ] **Simpler Alternative Considered**: What's the simplest solution that could work?
- [ ] **Team Capability Assessed**: Does your team have the skills?
- [ ] **Operational Readiness**: Can you monitor and maintain this?
- [ ] **Exit Strategy Planned**: How do you roll back if needed?

## 🚀 Quick Decision Tools

### 2-Minute Pattern Selection

1. **What's your biggest pain point RIGHT NOW?**
   - Slow responses → Caching + CDN
   - Service failures → Circuit Breaker + Health Checks  
   - Can't handle traffic → Load Balancer + Auto Scaling
   - Data inconsistency → Event Sourcing + CQRS

2. **What's your scale?**
   - < 1K users: Keep it simple, focus on features
   - 1K-100K: Standard web patterns (LB, cache, DB replicas)
   - 100K-10M: Microservices + distributed patterns
   - > 10M: Everything + custom solutions

3. **What's your team size?**
   - 1-3 devs: Avoid distributed patterns
   - 4-10 devs: Moderate complexity OK
   - > 10 devs: Full distributed architecture
