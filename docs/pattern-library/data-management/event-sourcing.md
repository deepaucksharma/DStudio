# Event Sourcing

!!! success "üèÜ Gold Standard Pattern"
    **Audit Trail & Time Travel Champion** ‚Ä¢ PayPal, Walmart, Financial Systems
    
    Event sourcing is critical for systems requiring complete audit trails, regulatory compliance, and the ability to reconstruct state at any point in time. Essential for financial and e-commerce systems.
    
    **Key Success Metrics:**
    - PayPal: 350M+ accounts with full history
    - Walmart: 100M+ daily orders tracked
    - Banking: Trillions in compliant transactions

## Essential Question

**How can we preserve the complete history of all changes while maintaining fast access to current state?**

The genius of event sourcing: Instead of storing just current state (balance = $100), we store the sequence of events that led there (opened, deposited $150, withdrew $50). This enables time travel, audit trails, and debugging capabilities impossible with traditional CRUD.

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### Use Event Sourcing When ‚úÖ

| Scenario | Why | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Audit trail required** | Complete history by design | Financial transactions, healthcare records |
| **Complex domain with many state changes** | Natural fit for events | Order lifecycle, user journey tracking |
| **Time-travel debugging needed** | Replay to any point | Production issue investigation |
| **Compliance regulations** | Immutable audit log | GDPR, SOX, HIPAA compliance |
| **Event-driven architecture** | Events are first-class | Microservices communication |
| **High-frequency writes** | Append-only is fast | Trading systems, IoT telemetry |

### DON'T Use When ‚ùå

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Simple CRUD operations** | Overhead not justified | Traditional database |
| **Storage cost constraints** | Unbounded growth | Compressed logging, snapshots |
| **Real-time aggregations** | Projection lag | Materialized views, OLAP |
| **Small development team** | Steep learning curve | Simpler architecture |
| **Immediate consistency required** | Projections are async | ACID transactions |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min)

### The Banking Ledger Analogy

<div class="axiom-box">
<h4>üî¨ Law 5: Distributed Knowledge (Epistemology)</h4>

Event sourcing embraces that "truth" is not a single state but a sequence of events. Each event is a fact that happened at a specific time.

**Key Insight**: The event log IS the source of truth, not the current state. State is ephemeral; events are eternal.
</div>

### Visual Architecture

### Core Concept

**Bank Account Example**:
- Traditional: Balance = $100 (how did we get here?)
- Event Sourcing: 
  - Opened: +$0
  - Deposited: +$150
  - Withdrew: -$50
  - Current: $100 (with complete history)

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min)

### Event Sourcing Architecture



### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Event Store** | Immutable event log | Kafka, EventStore, PostgreSQL |
| **Aggregate** | Business logic + validation | Domain model |
| **Projections** | Read-optimized views | Denormalized tables |
| **Snapshots** | Performance optimization | Periodic state capture |
| **Event Bus** | Event distribution | Kafka, RabbitMQ |

### Trade-off Analysis

| Aspect | Benefit | Cost |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Auditability** | Complete change history | Unbounded storage growth |
| **Debugging** | Time travel capability | Query complexity |
| **Flexibility** | Multiple projections | Eventual consistency |
| **Performance** | Fast writes (append-only) | Slower reads (projection lag) |

## Level 3: Deep Dive (15 min)

### Event Design Principles

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>üéØ Event Design Rules</h4>

1. **Events are facts** - Past tense (OrderPlaced, not PlaceOrder)
2. **Events are immutable** - Never modify, only append
3. **Events are domain-focused** - Business language, not technical
4. **Events are self-contained** - Include all necessary data
5. **Events are versioned** - Schema evolution support
</div>

### Event Flow Architecture

### Event Design Pattern

### Projection Update Strategies

| Strategy | Consistency | Performance | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Synchronous** | Strong | Slower writes | Critical views |
| **Asynchronous** | Eventual | Fast writes | Analytics, search |
| **Scheduled** | Delayed | Batch efficiency | Reports, summaries |
| **On-demand** | Lazy | No overhead | Rarely accessed data |

### Snapshot Strategy

## Level 4: Expert (20 min)

### Event Versioning Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Weak Schema** | Minor additions | Add optional fields |
| **Upcasting** | Compatible changes | Transform old to new |
| **Multiple Versions** | Breaking changes | Support both versions |
| **Event Migration** | Major refactoring | Replay with transformation |

### Performance Optimization Matrix

| Component | Optimization | Impact | Trade-off |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| **Snapshots** | Every 100 events | 10x faster replay | Storage overhead |
| **Projections** | Parallel processing | 4x throughput | Complexity |
| **Partitioning** | By aggregate ID | Linear scaling | Cross-aggregate queries |
| **Archival** | Old events to S3 | 90% cost reduction | Retrieval latency |

### Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Event granularity** | Too fine = noise, too coarse = loss | Domain-driven design |
| **Projection lag** | Stale read models | SLA monitoring + alerts |
| **Event ordering** | Out-of-order processing | Sequence numbers + buffering |
| **Schema evolution** | Breaking changes | Versioning strategy |

## Related Laws

This pattern directly addresses several fundamental distributed systems laws:

- **[Law 2: Asynchronous Reality](../../core-principles/laws/asynchronous-reality/)**: Event sourcing embraces asynchronous processing by storing events and building projections eventually consistently
- **[Law 4: Multidimensional Optimization](../../core-principles/laws/multidimensional-optimization/)**: Trades storage costs and complexity for auditability, time-travel debugging, and flexible read models
- **[Law 5: Distributed Knowledge](../../core-principles/laws/distributed-knowledge/)**: Events become the single source of truth, with different services maintaining their own projections of relevant events
- **[Law 7: Economic Reality](../../core-principles/laws/economic-reality/)**: Provides significant business value through audit compliance, debugging capabilities, and analytics, justifying the storage and complexity costs
