## The Complete Blueprint

The Shared Database pattern represents a legacy architecture where multiple services or applications access the same database instance for data persistence and retrieval. While this pattern offers simplicity and immediate data consistency through ACID transactions, it creates significant problems in modern distributed systems including tight coupling between services, deployment coordination nightmares, and scaling bottlenecks. This anti-pattern violates microservices principles by preventing independent service evolution and deployment. Although still found in legacy systems and during monolith-to-microservices transitions, understanding this pattern is crucial for recognizing its problems and implementing proper migration strategies to modern alternatives.

## Essential Question
## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |
**How do we ensure data consistency and reliability with shared database pattern?**


# Shared Database Pattern

!!! danger "🥉 Bronze Tier Pattern"
    **Legacy Pattern** • Consider modern alternatives
    
    While still in use in legacy systems, this pattern has been superseded by database-per-service and event-driven architectures. See migration guides for transitioning to modern approaches.

**The anti-pattern that refuses to die**

## Visual Architecture



## Why This Pattern is Problematic

| Problem | Impact | Modern Solution |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Tight Coupling** | Services can't evolve independently | Database per service |
| **No Autonomy** | Teams block each other | API contracts |
| **Scaling Bottleneck** | All services hit same DB | Distributed data |
| **Schema Conflicts** | Version coordination nightmare | Service ownership |
| **Performance Issues** | Noisy neighbor problems | Isolated resources |
| **Testing Complexity** | Can't test in isolation | Service virtualization |

## Common Symptoms of Shared Database Problems

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>💥 The Deployment Coordination Dance</h4>

**What Happens**: 
- Team A needs to add a column
- Team B's code breaks with new column
- Team C is in the middle of a release
- All teams must coordinate deployment

**Result**: 3-week deployment cycles, midnight releases

**Better Approach**: Each service owns its data and schema
</div>

    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```



## When Shared Database Might Be Acceptable

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>🎯 Limited Acceptable Use Cases</h4>

1. **Transitional State**
   - During monolith decomposition
   - Temporary measure with clear timeline

2. **Read-Only Analytics**
   - Shared read replicas for reporting
   - No write operations from services

3. **Legacy System Constraints**
   - When refactoring cost exceeds benefit
   - With clear isolation boundaries

**Even then**: Plan for eventual separation
</div>

## Modern Alternatives Comparison

| Pattern | Data Consistency | Autonomy | Complexity | Use When |
|---------|-----------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Database per Service** | Eventual | High | Medium | Default for microservices |
| **Event Sourcing** | Eventual | High | High | Audit requirements |
| **CQRS** | Eventual | High | High | Complex queries |
| **API Gateway** | Request-time | Medium | Low | Simple data needs |
| **Data Mesh** | Federated | Very High | Very High | Large organizations |

## Anti-Pattern Indicators

- [ ] Schema changes require multi-team coordination  
- [ ] "God tables" with 50+ columns
- [ ] Database becomes single point of failure
- [ ] Can't scale services independently
- [ ] Test data conflicts between teams
- [ ] Performance degradation affects all services
- [ ] Security boundaries are unclear

!!! experiment "💡 Quick Thought Experiment: Dependency Elimination Strategy"
    **Apply the 5-step framework to shared database elimination:**
    
    1. **INVENTORY**: Map all tables, stored procedures, views, triggers shared across services
    2. **PRIORITIZE**: Rank by coupling strength × blast radius (critical tables like User, Product rank highest)
    3. **ISOLATE**: Create service-specific schemas, replicated data, or API boundaries
    4. **MIGRATE**: Use Strangler Fig pattern with dual writes, then gradual service migration
    5. **MONITOR**: Track schema change frequency reduction, deployment independence metrics
    
    **Success Metric**: Achieve independent deployments - when Service A can deploy schema changes without coordinating with Services B, C, D
