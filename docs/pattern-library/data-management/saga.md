- Implement idempotent operations to handle retries
- Use state machines to track saga progress
- Monitor saga completion rates and failure patterns
- Set timeouts for each saga step (typically 30s-5min)
- Store saga state durably (database or event store)
- Test failure scenarios and compensation flows

# Saga Pattern

!!! success "🏆 Gold Standard Pattern"
    **Distributed Transaction Management** • Uber, Airbnb, Booking.com proven
    
    The de facto solution for managing distributed transactions across microservices. Enables business processes to span multiple services while maintaining consistency through compensations.
    
    **Key Success Metrics:**
    - Uber: 20M+ daily distributed transactions
    - Airbnb: 2M+ bookings coordinated daily
    - Booking.com: 1.5M+ room nights processed

## Essential Question

**How can we maintain data consistency across multiple services when ACID transactions can't span service boundaries?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### Use Saga When ✅
| Scenario | Why | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Multiple services involved** | Can't use local transactions | Order processing across payment, inventory, shipping |
| **Long-running processes** | Minutes to hours duration | Travel booking, loan approval workflows |
| **High availability required** | Can't afford blocking | E-commerce during Black Friday |
| **Services owned by different teams** | Can't coordinate deploys | Marketplace with independent sellers |
| **Need audit trail** | Regulatory compliance | Financial transactions, healthcare |

### DON'T Use When ❌
| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Single service transaction** | Unnecessary complexity | Use local ACID transaction |
| **Strong consistency required** | Sagas are eventually consistent | Use 2PC if you must |
| **Simple CRUD operations** | Overkill for simple ops | Direct database operations |
| **Synchronous user waiting** | Too slow for UI | Use optimistic UI + background |

### The $45M Problem That Created Sagas

!!! failure "Expedia's 2012 Nightmare"
    **What Happened**: Payment processed but hotel booking failed  
    **Impact**: 120,000 customers charged without reservations  
    **Recovery**: 6 weeks of manual reconciliation  
    **Cost**: $45M in refunds, credits, and reputation damage

### Visual Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "ACID Transaction (Can't Scale)"
        A[BEGIN] --> B[Book Flight]
        B --> C[Book Hotel]
        C --> D[Book Car]
        D --> E[Charge Card]
        E --> F[COMMIT/ROLLBACK]
    end
    
    subgraph "Saga Pattern (Scales Infinitely)"
        S1[Book Flight ✓] -->|Success| S2[Book Hotel ✓]
        S2 -->|Success| S3[Book Car ✗]
        S3 -->|Failure| C1[Cancel Hotel]
        C1 -->|Compensate| C2[Cancel Flight]
    end
```

### Core Insight

<div class="axiom-box">
<h4>🔬 Law 2: Asynchronous Reality</h4>

You can't have atomic commits across network boundaries. The best you can do is coordinate eventual consistency through compensations.

**Saga = Sequence of local transactions + Compensating actions**
</div>

### Production Failure Modes & Solutions

| Failure Type | Without Saga | With Saga | Real Example |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Partial Failure** | Inconsistent state | Automatic compensation | Uber: Trip cancelled mid-booking |
| **Timeout** | Hung transactions | Progress tracking | Amazon: Payment timeout handled |
| **Crash** | Lost transaction | State persistence | Netflix: Billing recovery |
| **Network Partition** | Split brain | Idempotent steps | Booking.com: Multi-region saga |

### Orchestration vs Choreography

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>🎯 Quick Decision Guide</h4>

**Choose Orchestration When:**
- Central visibility required (< 10 services)
- Complex conditional logic
- Clear business process owner

**Choose Choreography When:**
- Services are autonomous (> 10 services)  
- Simple linear flows
- High scalability needed

**Hybrid**: Critical path orchestrated, extensions choreographed

```

### Transaction Types

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>💡 The Three Saga Transaction Types</h4>

1. **Compensatable**: Can be undone (e.g., reserve → release inventory)
2. **Pivot**: The go/no-go decision point (e.g., payment authorization)
3. **Retriable**: Must eventually succeed (e.g., send email)

**Key**: Place pivot after compensatable, before retriable transactions
</div>

### State Persistence Strategy

```sql
-- Production schema from Uber
CREATE TABLE trip_sagas (
    saga_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    trip_id UUID NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- RUNNING, COMPLETED, COMPENSATING, FAILED
    current_step INTEGER NOT NULL,
    saga_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    
    INDEX idx_status_expires (status, expires_at) WHERE status = 'RUNNING'
);

CREATE TABLE saga_execution_log (
    saga_id UUID NOT NULL,
    step_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    idempotency_key VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    request_payload JSONB,
    response_payload JSONB,
    error_details JSONB,
    started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

</details>

### Idempotency Pattern

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Idempotent Operation"
        REQ[Request] --> KEY[Generate<br/>Idempotency Key]
        KEY --> CACHE{Check<br/>Cache}
        CACHE -->|Hit| RETURN[Return Cached]
        CACHE -->|Miss| LOCK[Acquire Lock]
        LOCK --> PROCESS[Process Once]
        PROCESS --> STORE[Store Result]
        STORE --> RETURN
    end
```

**Key Components**:
- **Idempotency Key**: `{trip_id}:{step}:{amount}` - uniquely identifies operation
- **Cache Layer**: Redis with TTL - prevents duplicate processing
- **Distributed Lock**: Ensures single execution across instances
- **Result Storage**: Atomic save for recovery

### Advanced Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Parallel Saga** | Independent steps | Execute services concurrently |
| **Composite Saga** | Reusable workflows | Nest sagas within sagas |
| **Routing Slip** | Dynamic flow | Saga carries execution plan |
| **Saga Versioning** | Live updates | Support multiple saga versions |

### Production Metrics

```yaml
# Critical saga metrics
metrics:
  saga_duration:
    description: Total execution time
    alert: p99 > 30s
    
  saga_success_rate:
    description: Percentage successful
    alert: < 95%
    
  compensation_rate:
    description: Sagas requiring rollback
    alert: > 10%
    
  stuck_sagas:
    description: Not progressing
    alert: > 10
```

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Pitfall | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Non-idempotent steps** | Double charges | Use idempotency keys |
| **Missing compensations** | Inconsistent state | Test all failure paths |
| **Infinite retries** | Resource exhaustion | Set max attempts + timeout |
| **Lost saga state** | Abandoned transactions | Durable state + recovery |

### Case Study: Uber's Trip Booking

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Hybrid Architecture"
        subgraph "Orchestrated Core"
            RQ[Ride Request] --> TSO[Trip Saga<br/>Orchestrator]
            TSO --> DS[Driver Service]
            TSO --> PS[Payment Service]
            TSO --> TS[Trip Service]
        end
        
        subgraph "Choreographed Updates"
            TS -->|Trip Started| LS[Location Service]
            LS -->|Location Update| NS[Notification Service]
            NS -->|ETA Update| RA[Rider App]
        end
        
        TSO -->|Failure| COMP[Compensation<br/>Manager]
    end
```

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Orchestration for trip creation (consistency critical)
- Choreography for real-time updates (scalability critical)
- Geographic sharding of orchestrators
- Optimistic driver locking

**Results**: <500ms latency, 99.7% success, 2.3% compensations

### Saga ROI Analysis

| Metric | Without Saga | With Saga | Impact |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Manual resolution** | $10/incident | $0.10/incident | 99% reduction |
| **Recovery time** | 6 hours | 30 seconds | 720x faster |
| **Success rate** | 85% | 99.7% | 14.7% improvement |
| **Engineer time** | 20 hrs/week | 1 hr/week | 95% reduction |

**Break-even Analysis**:
- Implementation cost: ~$8,000 per service
- Monthly savings: failure_rate × transactions × $9.90
- **ROI positive when**: 3+ services AND 1%+ failure rate
