- company: Uber
  implementation: Saga orchestrates ride booking across payment, dispatch, and driver
    services
  scale: 20M+ distributed transactions daily
- company: Airbnb
  implementation: Booking saga coordinates inventory, payment, and notification services

- company: Booking.com
  implementation: Complex travel booking sagas with multi-vendor coordination
  scale: 1.5M+ room nights booked daily

prerequisites: null
production-checklist:
- Choose orchestration vs choreography based on complexity
- Design compensating transactions for every step
- Implement idempotent operations to handle retries
- Use state machines to track saga progress
- Monitor saga completion rates and failure patterns
- Set timeouts for each saga step (typically 30s-5min)
- Store saga state durably (database or event store)
- Test failure scenarios and compensation flows

# Saga Pattern

!!! success "üèÜ Gold Standard Pattern"
    **Distributed Transaction Management** ‚Ä¢ Uber, Airbnb, Booking.com proven
    
    The de facto solution for managing distributed transactions across microservices. Enables business processes to span multiple services while maintaining consistency through compensations.
    
    **Key Success Metrics:**
    - Uber: 20M+ daily distributed transactions
    - Airbnb: 2M+ bookings coordinated daily
    - Booking.com: 1.5M+ room nights processed

## Essential Question

**How can we maintain data consistency across multiple services when ACID transactions can't span service boundaries?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### Use Saga When ‚úÖ
| Scenario | Why | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Multiple services involved** | Can't use local transactions | Order processing across payment, inventory, shipping |
| **Long-running processes** | Minutes to hours duration | Travel booking, loan approval workflows |
| **High availability required** | Can't afford blocking | E-commerce during Black Friday |
| **Services owned by different teams** | Can't coordinate deploys | Marketplace with independent sellers |
| **Need audit trail** | Regulatory compliance | Financial transactions, healthcare |

### DON'T Use When ‚ùå
| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Single service transaction** | Unnecessary complexity | Use local ACID transaction |
| **Strong consistency required** | Sagas are eventually consistent | Use 2PC if you must |
| **Simple CRUD operations** | Overkill for simple ops | Direct database operations |
| **Synchronous user waiting** | Too slow for UI | Use optimistic UI + background |

### The $45M Problem That Created Sagas

!!! failure "Expedia's 2012 Nightmare"
    **What Happened**: Payment processed but hotel booking failed  
    **Impact**: 120,000 customers charged without reservations  
    **Recovery**: 6 weeks of manual reconciliation  
    **Cost**: $45M in refunds, credits, and reputation damage

### Visual Architecture

### Core Insight

<div class="axiom-box">
<h4>üî¨ Law 2: Asynchronous Reality</h4>

You can't have atomic commits across network boundaries. The best you can do is coordinate eventual consistency through compensations.

**Saga = Sequence of local transactions + Compensating actions**
</div>

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min)

### Production Failure Modes & Solutions

| Failure Type | Without Saga | With Saga | Real Example |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Partial Failure** | Inconsistent state | Automatic compensation | Uber: Trip cancelled mid-booking |
| **Timeout** | Hung transactions | Progress tracking | Amazon: Payment timeout handled |
| **Crash** | Lost transaction | State persistence | Netflix: Billing recovery |
| **Network Partition** | Split brain | Idempotent steps | Booking.com: Multi-region saga |

### Orchestration vs Choreography

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>üéØ Quick Decision Guide</h4>

**Choose Orchestration When:**
- Central visibility required (< 10 services)
- Complex conditional logic
- Clear business process owner

**Choose Choreography When:**
- Services are autonomous (> 10 services)  
- Simple linear flows
- High scalability needed

**Hybrid**: Critical path orchestrated, extensions choreographed
</div>

### Architecture Comparison

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Complexity** | 5 | State machines, compensation logic, orchestration/choreography patterns, failure handling |
| **Performance Impact** | 3 | Multiple async steps, but enables horizontal scaling and decoupling |
| **Operational Overhead** | 4 | Monitoring saga health, debugging distributed failures, managing compensations |
| **Team Expertise Required** | 5 | Deep understanding of distributed transactions, eventual consistency, workflow design |
| **Scalability** | 4 | Excellent for distributed systems, handles service autonomy and failure isolation |

**Overall Recommendation: ‚úÖ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** - Essential for distributed business processes across microservices.

### Saga Execution Flow



### Transaction Types

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° The Three Saga Transaction Types</h4>

1. **Compensatable**: Can be undone (e.g., reserve ‚Üí release inventory)
2. **Pivot**: The go/no-go decision point (e.g., payment authorization)
3. **Retriable**: Must eventually succeed (e.g., send email)

**Key**: Place pivot after compensatable, before retriable transactions
</div>

### Idempotency Pattern



### Production Checklist ‚úì

- [ ] Idempotency for all steps
- [ ] Compensation for every forward transaction
- [ ] Timeout handling (30s-5min per step)
- [ ] State persistence with recovery
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard for sagas
- [ ] Test all failure scenarios
- [ ] Document saga flows
- [ ] Alert on stuck sagas
