## Essential Question
## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |
**How do we ensure data consistency and reliability with data lake pattern?**


# Data Lake Pattern

!!! warning "ü•â Bronze Pattern"
    **Use with Caution** ‚Ä¢ Evolving to Data Mesh architectures
    
    Data Lakes often become "data swamps" without proper governance. Modern architectures are moving toward domain-oriented data mesh patterns for better ownership and quality.
    
    **Migration Path**: Consider Data Mesh for new implementations

**Store everything now, figure out value later**

## Visual Architecture



## Data Lake vs Data Warehouse vs Data Mesh

| Aspect | Data Lake | Data Warehouse | Data Mesh |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Data Format** | All formats (raw) | Structured only | Domain-specific |
| **Schema** | Schema-on-read | Schema-on-write | Schema by domain |
| **Processing** | ELT | ETL | Domain pipelines |
| **Cost** | Low storage | High compute | Distributed |
| **Agility** | High | Low | Very high |
| **Governance** | Challenging | Centralized | Federated |
| **Users** | Data scientists | Business analysts | Domain teams |

    A[Input] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[Output]
    B --> D[Error Handling]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```



## Common Pitfalls

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üí• The Data Swamp Problem</h4>

**What Happens**: 
- No metadata or cataloging
- Unknown data quality
- Duplicate data everywhere
- No one knows what's in the lake

**Result**: $10M+ invested, 90% of data never used

**Prevention**:
- Mandatory metadata on ingestion
- Data quality scores
- Automated cataloging
- Regular cleanup policies
</div>

## Technology Stack Comparison

| Component | AWS | Azure | GCP | Open Source |
|-----------|-----|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Storage** | S3 | ADLS Gen2 | GCS | HDFS/MinIO |
| **Catalog** | Glue | Purview | Data Catalog | Apache Atlas |
| **Processing** | EMR | Databricks | Dataproc | Spark |
| **Query** | Athena | Synapse | BigQuery | Presto/Trino |
| **Governance** | Lake Formation | Purview | Dataplex | Apache Ranger |

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Complexity** | 5 | Data governance, cataloging, multi-format support, lifecycle management |
| **Performance Impact** | 3 | Good for batch analytics, poor for real-time; query performance varies |
| **Operational Overhead** | 5 | Data governance, quality monitoring, catalog maintenance, access control |
| **Team Expertise Required** | 4 | Data engineering, governance frameworks, query optimization, security |
| **Scalability** | 4 | Excellent storage scaling, but query performance can degrade without partitioning |

**Overall Recommendation: ‚ö†Ô∏è USE WITH CAUTION** - Consider Data Mesh or modern data platform architectures for new implementations.

## Decision Framework

## Level 4: Expert (20 min) {#expert}

### Advanced Techniques

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Lakehouse Architecture**
   - When to apply: Need both flexibility and reliability
   - Impact: 10x query performance improvement over traditional lakes
   - Trade-off: Higher complexity but better governance

2. **Domain-Oriented Data Products**
   - When to apply: Large organizations with multiple teams
   - Impact: 5x faster time-to-insight with better data quality
   - Trade-off: Requires organizational change and tooling investment

### Scaling Considerations

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Dashboard Panel |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Data Quality Score | <80% | Quality trend over time by domain |
| Storage Growth Rate | >20% monthly | Cost projection and utilization |
| Query Success Rate | <90% | Error types and frequency |
| Time to Value | >90 days | From ingestion to first business use |

### Real-World Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: Uber's Evolution from Data Lake to Data Mesh

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° Production Insights from Uber</h4>

**Challenge**: 100PB data lake became unmanageable - 70% of data was never used, data quality issues plagued ML models, and teams couldn't find relevant datasets

**Implementation**: Evolved to domain-specific data products with:
- Rides domain: Trip data, driver analytics
- Eats domain: Restaurant and delivery metrics  
- Marketplace domain: Supply-demand matching data

**Results**: 
- **Data Quality**: Improved from 60% to 95% usable data
- **Time to Insight**: Reduced from 6 months to 2 weeks
- **Cost Optimization**: 40% reduction in storage costs through better lifecycle management

**Lessons Learned**: Domain ownership is crucial - teams that own the data care about its quality and relevance
