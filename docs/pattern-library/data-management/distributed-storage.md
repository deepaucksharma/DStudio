## Essential Question

**How do we ensure data consistency and reliability with distributed storage?**

# Distributed Storage

## ü§î Essential Questions

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>How do you store petabytes of data reliably when any single machine can fail?</h4>

**The Challenge**: Single machines have limited capacity and are single points of failure

**The Pattern**: Distribute data across many machines with replication and coordination

**Critical Decision**: How to balance consistency, availability, and partition tolerance?
</div>

!!! warning "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Infinite scale with infinite complexity** ‚Ä¢ Use when single-node limits are truly exceeded
    
    Distributed storage enables petabyte-scale systems but brings CAP theorem trade-offs, complex failure modes, and significant operational overhead.
    
    **Trade-offs**:
    - ‚úÖ Scale beyond any single machine
    - ‚úÖ Survive multiple failures
    - ‚ùå Complex consistency guarantees
    - ‚ùå Network partition handling

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>üéØ Decision Guide</h4>

**Perfect for:**
- Data exceeding single machine capacity (>10TB)
- Global applications needing data locality
- Systems requiring 99.99%+ availability
- Write-heavy workloads needing horizontal scaling
- Cost-effective cold storage at scale

**Avoid when:**
- Data fits on a single machine (<1TB)
- Strong consistency is critical
- Simple master-slave replication suffices
- Operational complexity exceeds team capability
- Cost of distribution exceeds benefits

**Key trade-off**: Massive scale and availability vs. consistency guarantees and operational complexity

## Implementation Decision Tree

## üéì Key Takeaways

1. **CAP theorem is unavoidable** - Choose your trade-offs wisely
2. **Replication ‚â† Backup** - Different failures need different solutions
3. **Monitor everything** - You can't fix what you can't see
4. **Plan for failure** - Hardware fails, networks partition, software has bugs
5. **Start simple** - Don't use distributed storage until you need it
