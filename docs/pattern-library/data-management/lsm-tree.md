# LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree)

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Write-Optimized Storage Specialist** ‚Ä¢ For database engine builders
    
    LSM trees are fundamental to modern write-heavy storage systems but require deep storage engine expertise. Critical for database implementers, valuable for understanding modern database internals.
    
    **Best For:** Database/storage engine development, write-heavy systems, time-series storage

## Essential Question

**How can we optimize write performance by converting random writes to sequential writes?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Building write-heavy databases | Time-series databases | 10-100x write throughput improvement |
| Log processing systems | Event stream storage | Sequential I/O matches write patterns |
| Key-value storage engines | Embedded databases | Efficient storage with good compression |
| SSD-optimized systems | Modern storage hardware | Minimizes write amplification |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Application-level development | Database handles storage | Use existing LSM-based databases |
| Read-heavy workloads | Read amplification penalty | B-tree based storage engines |
| Small datasets | Memory complexity overhead | In-memory structures |
| Consistent read latency needed | Variable read performance | Traditional RDBMS engines |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min) {#intuition}

### The Story
Imagine organizing papers on your desk. Instead of filing each paper immediately (random writes), you stack them in order on your desk (MemTable), then periodically file entire stacks into organized folders (SSTables). This batching makes the overall process much faster.

### Visual Metaphor
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Incoming Writes] --> B[Memory Buffer<br/>Stack & Sort]
    B --> C[Flush to Disk<br/>Sequential Write]
    C --> D[Merge Periodically<br/>Keep Organized]
    
    style B fill:#5448C8,stroke:#3f33a6,color:#fff
    style C fill:#81c784,stroke:#388e3c,color:#fff
```

### Core Insight
> **Key Takeaway:** Buffer writes in memory and batch them to disk sequentially - trading read complexity for write performance.

### In One Sentence
LSM trees achieve high write throughput by buffering writes in memory, flushing to sorted disk files, and periodically merging files to maintain query performance.

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min) {#foundation}

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without This Pattern</h4>

**Time-Series DB Co, 2018**: Used B-tree storage for IoT sensor data, achieving only 1K writes/sec due to random I/O patterns and constant tree rebalancing.

**Impact**: Couldn't handle sensor data volume, 99.9% CPU on I/O waits, required 50x hardware scaling
</div>

### How It Works

#### Architecture Overview

    subgraph "LSM Tree Levels"
        W[Writes] --> M[MemTable<br/>In Memory]
        M --> L0[Level 0<br/>Unsorted SSTables]

    end

    classDef secondary fill:#00BCD4,stroke:#0097a7,color:#fff
    
    class M,W primary
    class L0,L1,L2,F,C secondary
```

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **MemTable** | Buffer writes in memory | Fast writes, sorted structure |
| **WAL** | Ensure durability | Crash recovery for MemTable |
| **SSTables** | Immutable sorted files | Persistent storage |
| **Compaction** | Merge and cleanup | Maintain read performance |

### Basic Example

```python
class SimpleLSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memtable = {}  # In practice: skip list or B-tree
        self.wal = WriteAheadLog()
        self.sstables = []
        self.memtable_limit = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        # Write to WAL for durability
        self.wal.append(f"PUT {key} {value}")
        
        # Add to MemTable
        self.memtable[key] = value
        
        # Check if flush needed
        if self.memtable_size() > self.memtable_limit:
            self.flush_memtable()
    
    def get(self, key):
        # Check MemTable first (newest data)
        if key in self.memtable:
            return self.memtable[key]
        
        # Check SSTables from newest to oldest
        for sstable in reversed(self.sstables):
            value = sstable.get(key)
            if value is not None:
                return value
        
        return None  # Not found
    
    def flush_memtable(self):
        # Create new SSTable from MemTable
        sstable = SSTable.from_dict(self.memtable)
        self.sstables.append(sstable)
        self.memtable.clear()
```

### Implementation Details

#### State Management
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active: System start
    Active --> Writing: Accept writes
    Writing --> Buffering: Add to MemTable
    Buffering --> Flushing: MemTable full
    Flushing --> Compacting: Background merge
    Compacting --> Active: Continue operations
    
    Flushing --> Writing: Continue accepting writes
    Compacting --> Writing: Non-blocking operation
```

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **MemTable Structure** | Skip List vs B-tree | Skip List: Concurrent, complex<br>B-tree: Simple, locks | Skip list for production |
| **Compaction Strategy** | Size-tiered vs Leveled | Size-tiered: Write-optimized<br>Leveled: Read-optimized | Match workload characteristics |
| **Level Multiplier** | 2x vs 10x | 2x: More levels, less space<br>10x: Fewer levels, more space | 10x for most workloads |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Write stalls**: Compaction can't keep up with writes ‚Üí Monitor compaction lag and tune thread counts
2. **Tombstone accumulation**: Deleted keys consume space ‚Üí Implement proper tombstone compaction
3. **Read amplification explosion**: Too many levels ‚Üí Balance write throughput vs read performance
</div>

### Production Considerations

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Range | Optimization Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Write Throughput | 10K-1M ops/sec | Maximize sequential I/O |
| Read Latency | 1-10ms | Minimize level checks with bloom filters |
| Write Amplification | 2-10x | Tune compaction frequency |
| Space Amplification | 1.1-2x | Choose appropriate compaction strategy |

## Level 4: Expert (20 min) {#expert}

### Advanced Techniques

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Tiered + Leveled Hybrid**
   - When to apply: Mixed read/write workloads
   - Impact: Balance write throughput with read performance
   - Trade-off: Increased compaction complexity

2. **Partitioned Compaction**
   - When to apply: Very large datasets with hot/cold data
   - Impact: Reduce compaction overhead on cold data
   - Trade-off: More complex space management

### Scaling Considerations

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Single Node"
        A1[Single LSM Tree<br/>100K ops/sec]
    end
    
    subgraph "Sharded Node"
        B1[Multiple LSM Trees<br/>1M ops/sec]
    end
    
    subgraph "Distributed"
        C1[Distributed LSM<br/>10M+ ops/sec]
    end
    
    A1 -->|Core limits| B1
    B1 -->|Memory/disk limits| C1
```

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Dashboard Panel |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Write Stall Rate** | >1% of operations | Histogram of stall durations |
| **Compaction Lag** | >500MB backlog | Queue depth over time |
| **Read Amplification** | >10 file checks/read | Average files checked per read |
| **Space Amplification** | >3x logical size | Disk usage vs logical data size |

### Real-World Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: RocksDB at Facebook

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° Production Insights from RocksDB</h4>

**Challenge**: Scale write-heavy social media workloads across thousands of services

**Implementation**: Pluggable compaction strategies, column families, and extensive tuning options

**Results**: 
- **Write Throughput**: 1M+ operations/second per instance
- **Read Performance**: Sub-millisecond p99 with proper tuning
- **Resource Efficiency**: 10x better write throughput than B-tree alternatives

**Lessons Learned**: LSM tuning is critical - default parameters rarely optimal; bloom filters essential for read performance; compaction strategy must match workload
