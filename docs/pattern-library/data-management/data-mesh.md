# Data Mesh

!!! info "Pattern Overview"
    **Category**: data-management  
    **Complexity**: Medium  
    **Use Cases**: large organizations, domain-driven data, data governance

## Problem

Traditional centralized data platforms become bottlenecks in large organizations. They struggle with diverse domain needs, create single points of failure, and cannot scale with organizational growth.

## Solution

Data mesh treats data as a product owned by domain teams. It provides decentralized data architecture with domain ownership, self-serve data infrastructure, federated governance, and product thinking.

## Implementation

```python
## Example implementation
class DataMeshPlatform:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Provides domain autonomy
- Enables organizational scalability
- Improves reduced bottlenecks

**Cons:**
- Increases governance complexity
- Requires duplication of efforts
- May impact skill requirements

## When to Use

- When you need large organizations
- For systems that require multiple business domains
- In scenarios with complex data requirements
