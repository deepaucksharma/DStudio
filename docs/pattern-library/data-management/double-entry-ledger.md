# Double-Entry Ledger

!!! info "Pattern Overview"
    **Category**: data-management  
    **Complexity**: Medium  
    **Use Cases**: financial systems, accounting, audit compliance

## Problem

Financial systems require absolute accuracy and auditability. Simple account balance tracking cannot provide the accountability, error detection, and compliance needed for financial operations.

## Solution

Double-entry bookkeeping records every transaction as both a debit and credit, ensuring books always balance. This provides error detection, complete audit trails, and regulatory compliance.

## Implementation

```python
# Example implementation
class DoubleEntryLedger:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Provides mathematical accuracy
- Enables complete audit trails
- Improves error detection

**Cons:**
- Increases storage overhead
- Requires complexity
- May impact transaction validation

## When to Use

- When you need financial systems
- For systems that require payment processing
- In scenarios with accounting systems
