# Idempotency

!!! info "Pattern Overview"
    **Category**: data-management  
    **Complexity**: Medium  
    **Use Cases**: distributed systems, API design, payment processing

## Problem

Network failures and retries can cause duplicate operations, leading to incorrect system state. APIs and distributed operations must handle retries safely without unintended side effects.

## Solution

Idempotency ensures operations produce the same result when executed multiple times. This is achieved through idempotency keys, deduplication, and state checking mechanisms.

## Implementation

```python
## Example implementation
class IdempotencyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Provides safe retry semantics
- Enables consistent system state
- Improves network fault tolerance

**Cons:**
- Increases additional storage requirements
- Requires implementation complexity
- May impact performance overhead

## When to Use

- When you need payment systems
- For systems that require distributed APIs
- In scenarios with retry-prone operations
