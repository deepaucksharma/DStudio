## The Complete Blueprint

The Deduplication pattern eliminates redundant data storage by identifying and removing duplicate content through cryptographic hashing and content-addressable storage techniques. This pattern is essential for systems handling large volumes of potentially duplicate data, such as backup systems, cloud storage platforms, and data pipelines. Deduplication works by computing fingerprints (typically SHA-256 hashes) of data blocks or files, storing only unique content, and maintaining reference counts for shared data. The approach can achieve dramatic storage savings‚Äîoften 10-100x reduction‚Äîwhile requiring careful management of hash collisions, garbage collection, and performance trade-offs between CPU overhead and storage efficiency.

### What You'll Master

- **Content-addressable storage** using cryptographic hashing for unique data identification and retrieval
- **Chunking strategies** including fixed-size, variable-size, and sliding-window approaches for optimal deduplication ratios
- **Hash collision handling** with verification mechanisms and fallback strategies for data integrity
- **Reference counting and garbage collection** for automated cleanup of unreferenced data blocks

- **Storage tiering integration** combining deduplication with hot/warm/cold storage policies for cost efficiency

## Essential Question

**How do we ensure data consistency and reliability with deduplication?**


# Deduplication

!!! warning "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Massive storage savings with processing overhead** ‚Ä¢ Use when duplicate data is common and storage costs matter
    
    Deduplication can reduce storage by 90%+ in backup systems but requires CPU for hashing, complex reference tracking, and careful handling of hash collisions. Best suited for write-once, read-many workloads where storage efficiency outweighs processing costs.


## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |

## Overview

Deduplication identifies and eliminates redundant copies of data, storing each unique piece only once. This pattern is crucial for efficient storage systems, backup solutions, and message processing pipelines.
