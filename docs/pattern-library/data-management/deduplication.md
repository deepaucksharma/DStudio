## Essential Question

**How do we ensure data consistency and reliability with deduplication?**


# Deduplication

!!! warning "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Massive storage savings with processing overhead** ‚Ä¢ Use when duplicate data is common and storage costs matter
    
    Deduplication can reduce storage by 90%+ in backup systems but requires CPU for hashing, complex reference tracking, and careful handling of hash collisions. Best suited for write-once, read-many workloads where storage efficiency outweighs processing costs.


## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |

## Overview

Deduplication identifies and eliminates redundant copies of data, storing each unique piece only once. This pattern is crucial for efficient storage systems, backup solutions, and message processing pipelines.

## Core Concepts

### Deduplication Strategies



| Strategy | Granularity | Dedup Ratio | CPU Cost | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **File-Level** | Entire files | Low | Minimal | Simple backups |
| **Fixed-Block** | Fixed chunks | Medium | Low | Block storage |
| **Variable-Block** | Content-defined | High | Medium | Efficient storage |
| **Byte-Level** | Individual bytes | Maximum | Very High | Specialized |

## Implementation Patterns

### Inline vs Post-Process Deduplication

| Approach | When Dedup Occurs | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------------|------|------|
| **Inline** | During write | Immediate savings | Higher write latency |
| **Post-Process** | After write | Fast writes | Temporary 2x storage |
| **Near-line** | Shortly after | Balanced | Complex scheduling |

### Reference Management

## Deduplication Algorithms

### Content-Defined Chunking (CDC)

**Rabin Fingerprinting Example**:
- Average chunk size: 8KB
- Min chunk: 2KB
- Max chunk: 64KB
- Boundary when: `hash & 0x1FFF == 0x1FFF`

### Message Deduplication

## Common Pitfalls

!!! danger "Anti-Patterns"
    - **Weak hashes**: MD5 for security-critical dedup
    - **No verification**: Trusting hashes without collision handling
    - **Unbounded index**: Memory exhaustion from fingerprint index
    - **Aggressive dedup**: CPU overhead exceeds storage savings
