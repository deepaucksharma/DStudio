## üö´ Anti-Pattern Warnings

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Impact | Fix |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-----|
| **Pattern Soup** | Using too many patterns without clear need | High complexity, maintenance burden | Start simple, add patterns incrementally |
| **Premature Optimization** | Adding advanced patterns before proving need | Wasted effort, over-engineering | Measure first, optimize second |
| **Cargo Cult Implementation** | Copying patterns without understanding context | Ineffective solutions, hidden problems | Understand the problem before applying patterns |
| **Single Pattern Thinking** | Relying on one pattern for all problems | Brittle solutions, missed opportunities | Use pattern combinations appropriately |
| **No Monitoring** | Implementing patterns without observability | Invisible failures, debugging nightmares | Add monitoring from day one |

### Pattern Overuse Symptoms

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Recommended Action |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Debugging takes >2 hours | Too many abstraction layers | Simplify architecture, remove unnecessary patterns |
| New features take >2 weeks | Over-engineered system | Focus on core patterns, remove complexity |
| Team velocity decreasing | Cognitive overload | Pattern training, documentation, simplification |
| Production issues increasing | Pattern conflicts | Review pattern interactions, fix conflicts |

## üéØ Context-Specific Guidance

### Startup Phase (0-50K users)
**Focus**: Shipping features fast while building on solid foundations

```yaml
Essential:
  - Load Balancing (2 servers minimum)
  - Health Check (basic availability)
  - Database Replication (backup & read scaling)

Avoid:
  - Microservices (too much complexity)
  - Advanced sharding (premature optimization)
  - Complex event sourcing (over-engineering)

Next Phase Triggers:
  - Response time >500ms ‚Üí Add caching
  - Frequent downtime ‚Üí Add circuit breaker
  - Manual scaling pain ‚Üí Add auto-scaling
```

### Growth Phase (50K-1M users)  
**Focus**: Handling scale while maintaining velocity

```yaml
Essential:
  - Circuit Breaker (external API protection)
  - Caching (performance improvement)
  - Auto-scaling (handle traffic spikes)
  - Rate Limiting (abuse protection)

Consider:
  - CQRS (if read/write patterns differ)
  - Sharding (if database becomes bottleneck)
  - CDN (if global users or static content)

Next Phase Triggers:
  - Database queries >100ms ‚Üí Consider sharding
  - Complex workflows ‚Üí Consider saga pattern
  - Audit requirements ‚Üí Consider event sourcing
```

### Scale Phase (1M+ users)
**Focus**: Optimization and specialized patterns

```yaml
Essential:
  - Sharding (data layer scaling)
  - Event-Driven Architecture (service decoupling)
  - Service Discovery (microservices support)
  - Advanced monitoring (observability)

Advanced:
  - Event Sourcing (audit & replay capabilities)
  - Saga Pattern (complex workflow management)
  - Service Mesh (cross-cutting concerns)
  - Geographic Distribution (global scale)

Optimization Focus:
  - Pattern performance tuning
  - Custom pattern development
  - Domain-specific optimizations
```

## üìã Quick Decision Checklist

Before implementing any pattern, answer these questions:

### Problem Validation
- [ ] **Is this a real problem?** Do you have metrics showing the issue?
- [ ] **What's the impact?** How many users/requests are affected?
- [ ] **What's the trend?** Is this problem getting worse over time?
- [ ] **What's the cost of inaction?** Revenue, user experience, or operational cost?

### Pattern Selection
- [ ] **Does this pattern solve the core problem?** Not just symptoms
- [ ] **What are the trade-offs?** Complexity vs benefit analysis
- [ ] **Do we have the expertise?** Team capability to implement and maintain
- [ ] **What are the dependencies?** Other patterns or infrastructure needed

### Implementation Planning
- [ ] **How will we measure success?** Define metrics before implementation
- [ ] **What's the rollback plan?** How to undo if things go wrong
- [ ] **How will we monitor it?** Observability and alerting strategy
- [ ] **What's the maintenance overhead?** Ongoing operational costs

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Performance improvement**: Quantify expected gains
- [ ] **Reliability improvement**: Define availability targets
- [ ] **Complexity acceptable**: Team can understand and maintain
- [ ] **Cost justified**: Benefits outweigh implementation and operational costs

## Summary

This cheatsheet provides the essential guidance for pattern selection in distributed systems. Remember:

1. **Start Simple**: Don't over-engineer from the beginning
2. **Measure First**: Use data to drive pattern selection decisions  
3. **Incremental Adoption**: Add patterns as you encounter specific challenges
4. **Monitor Everything**: Implement observability for all patterns
5. **Team Capability**: Only adopt patterns your team can maintain

The most successful distributed systems aren't those that use the most patterns, but those that use the right patterns applied at the right time to solve specific, measurable problems.

Use this guide as a reference during architecture discussions, but always validate pattern choices against your specific context, constraints, and team capabilities.
