title: Sharding (Data Partitioning)
description: Horizontally partition data across multiple databases to scale beyond single-machine limits
excellence_tier: gold
pattern_status: recommended
introduced: 2000-01
current_relevance: mainstream
category: scaling
essential_question: How do we scale beyond single-machine database limits while maintaining query performance?
modern_examples:
  - {'company': 'Discord', 'implementation': 'Channel-based sharding for messages', 'scale': '1T+ messages, 4,096 logical shards on 177 Cassandra nodes'}
  - {'company': 'Pinterest', 'implementation': 'User-based sharding with virtual buckets', 'scale': '240B+ pins on 8,192 virtual shards across 800 MySQL servers'}
  - {'company': 'YouTube/Vitess', 'implementation': 'Automatic sharding proxy for MySQL', 'scale': '100,000+ MySQL instances handling exabytes of data'}
production_checklist:
  - Choose sharding key matching access patterns (user_id, tenant_id)
  - Start with more virtual shards than needed (easier to merge than split)
  - Implement shard-aware connection pooling and routing
  - Monitor shard balance continuously (hot spot detection)
  - Plan resharding strategy from day one
  - Build cross-shard query capabilities carefully
  - Use consistent hashing for stable assignment
  - Implement distributed transactions only if essential

# Sharding (Data Partitioning)

!!! success "üèÜ Gold Standard Pattern"
    **Horizontal Scaling Foundation** ‚Ä¢ Discord, Pinterest, YouTube proven at planet scale
    
    Sharding enables linear scaling by distributing data across multiple machines based on a partition key. Essential when vertical scaling hits its limits.
    
    **Key Success Metrics:**
    - Discord: 1T+ messages across 4,096 logical shards
    - Pinterest: 240B+ pins on 8,192 virtual shards  
    - YouTube: 100,000+ MySQL instances via Vitess

## Essential Question
**How do we scale beyond single-machine database limits while maintaining query performance?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

‚úÖ **Use Sharding When:**
| Indicator | Threshold | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Data size | > 5TB | User profiles, messages |
| Write throughput | > 10K/sec | Social media posts |
| Growth rate | > 2x/year | Viral applications |
| Geographic distribution | Multi-region | Global services |

‚ùå **Avoid Sharding When:**
| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| < 1TB data | Complexity not worth it | Vertical scaling |
| Complex JOINs | Cross-shard queries kill performance | Denormalization |
| ACID critical | Distributed transactions are hard | Single master |
| Small team | High operational overhead | Managed services |

## Sharding Decision Framework

## Level 1: Intuition

### The Library Card Catalog Analogy
Think of a massive library with millions of books. Instead of one enormous catalog:
- A-F ‚Üí Catalog 1
- G-M ‚Üí Catalog 2  
- N-S ‚Üí Catalog 3
- T-Z ‚Üí Catalog 4

Each catalog is smaller, faster to search, and can be updated independently.

### Single Database vs Sharded

| Metric | Single Database | Sharded (4 shards) | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------| 
| Max Storage | 10TB | 40TB | 4x |
| Write Throughput | 10K/s | 40K/s | 4x |
| Fault Impact | 100% down | 25% affected | 75% better |
| Query Latency | 500ms | 50ms | 10x faster |

| Strategy | Distribution | Query Support | Resharding | Best For |
|----------|--------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Hash-Based** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Even | ‚ùå No range queries | üî¥ Very Hard | User profiles, sessions |
| **Range-Based** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Can hotspot | ‚úÖ Range queries | üü° Hard | Time-series, logs |

### Rebalancing Strategies

| Strategy | Complexity | Downtime | When to Use |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Virtual Shards** | Low | None | Default choice - map multiple logical shards to physical |
| **Consistent Hashing** | Low | None | Dynamic clusters with frequent node changes |
| **Split & Merge** | High | Minimal | When virtual shards insufficient |
| **Shadow Writes** | Medium | None | Zero-downtime migrations |
| **Read-Write Split** | Medium | None | Gradual migration with verification |

### Rebalancing Decision Flow

### Cross-Shard Query Patterns

| Pattern | Performance | Use Case | Optimization |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Scatter-Gather** | O(n) shards | Global search | Parallel execution, result caching |
| **Targeted Multi-Shard** | O(k) shards | Known subset | Shard pruning, query routing |
| **Shard-Local** | O(1) | 95% of queries | Co-locate related data |
| **Two-Phase Lookup** | 2x latency | Secondary indexes | Denormalize hot paths |

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Pitfall | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Hot Shards** | One shard gets 80% traffic | Composite keys, virtual shards, time-based sub-sharding |
| **Cross-Shard JOINs** | 100x slower queries | Denormalize, maintain read views, use CQRS |
| **Shard Key Changes** | Can't move data | Immutable keys, directory-based sharding |
| **Unbalanced Growth** | Some shards fill faster | Predictive rebalancing, usage-based splitting |

### Production Case Studies

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üí• Discord's Resharding Crisis (2020)</h4>

**Scale**: 1T+ messages, growing 100M/day
**Problem**: Popular channels created 100x shard imbalance
**Impact**: P99 latency degraded from 50ms ‚Üí 5 seconds

**Solution Architecture**:
```
Before: channel_id % 128 ‚Üí Direct shard mapping
After:  channel_id ‚Üí bucket (1 of 4096) ‚Üí shard (1 of 128)
```

**Results**: 
- 95% reduction in P99 latency
- Zero-downtime rebalancing capability
- Handles 1M+ messages/second

## üéì Key Takeaways

1. **Start with more shards than you need** - Merging is easier than splitting
2. **Choose your shard key wisely** - It determines everything
3. **Monitor shard balance religiously** - Hotspots kill performance
4. **Plan for resharding from day one** - You will need it
5. **Avoid cross-shard operations** - They're expensive at scale


## Related Laws

This pattern directly addresses several fundamental distributed systems laws:

- **[Law 4: Multidimensional Optimization](../../core-principles/laws/multidimensional-optimization.md)**: Sharding represents the classic trade-off between scalability and complexity - gaining horizontal scale at the cost of cross-shard operation difficulty
- **[Law 5: Distributed Knowledge](../../core-principles/laws/distributed-knowledge.md)**: Data is partitioned across shards, meaning no single node has complete knowledge of the dataset
- **[Law 7: Economic Reality](../../core-principles/laws/economic-reality.md)**: Enables cost-effective scaling by allowing horizontal scaling on commodity hardware rather than expensive vertical scaling
