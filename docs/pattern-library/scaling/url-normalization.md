## Essential Question
## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### When to Use

| Scenario | Why It Fits | Alternative If Not |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| High availability required | Pattern provides resilience | Consider simpler approach |
| Scalability is critical | Handles load distribution | Monolithic might suffice |
| Distributed coordination needed | Manages complexity | Centralized coordination |

### When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Why to Avoid | Better Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Simple applications | Unnecessary complexity | Direct implementation |
| Low traffic systems | Overhead not justified | Basic architecture |
| Limited resources | High operational cost | Simpler patterns |
**How do we handle increasing load without sacrificing performance using url normalization?**

# URL Normalization

!!! success "ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Essential for Web-Scale Systems** â€¢ Recommended for most URL processing
    
    URL normalization is crucial for any system processing web URLs at scale. While implementation requires careful attention to edge cases, the benefits in deduplication, caching efficiency, and accurate analytics make it essential for web crawlers, shorteners, and caching systems.

## The Essential Question

**How can we convert different URL variations that point to the same resource into a single canonical form to eliminate duplicates and improve system efficiency?**

### The Story

Library with multiple catalog systems: same book appears as:
- "JavaScript: The Good Parts" 
- "javascript: the good parts"
- "JavaScript - The Good Parts (2008 Edition)"
- "JS: Good Parts"

Librarians create canonical entries so patrons find books efficiently.

URL normalization does the same for web addresses.

### In One Sentence

**URL Normalization**: Converting multiple URL variations into a standard canonical form to eliminate duplicates and improve processing efficiency.

### Real-World Parallel

Like postal addresses - "123 Main St", "123 Main Street", "123 MAIN ST" all go to the same place, but systems work better with one standard format.

### The Problem Space

!!! danger "ðŸ”¥ Without Normalization: Web Crawler Disaster"
    Search engine crawler encountered:
    - 50M URLs discovered
    - 35M were duplicates (70% waste!)
    - $500K monthly crawling budget on duplicates
    - Inconsistent search results
    - Cache hit rate: 12% instead of 80%
    URL normalization would have saved $350K/month.

### URL Components and Variations


### Normalization Rules (RFC 3986)

| Component | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Scheme** | Lowercase | `HTTP://` â†’ `http://` |
| **Host** | Lowercase, remove www | `WWW.EXAMPLE.COM` â†’ `example.com` |
| **Port** | Remove default ports | `:443` (HTTPS), `:80` (HTTP) â†’ remove |
| **Path** | URL decode, resolve dots | `/a/../b` â†’ `/b` |
| **Query** | Sort parameters, decode | `?b=2&a=1` â†’ `?a=1&b=2` |
| **Fragment** | Usually remove | `#section` â†’ remove |

### Advanced Normalization Strategies

**System Flow:** Input â†’ Processing â†’ Output


### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Complexity** | 3 | Moderate complexity with many edge cases and RFC compliance requirements |
| **Performance Impact** | 4 | Significant improvements in cache hit rates and storage efficiency, modest processing overhead |
| **Operational Overhead** | 3 | Requires monitoring normalization rules, handling edge cases, and tuning for specific domains |
| **Team Expertise Required** | 3 | Understanding of URL structure, HTTP standards, and web architecture principles |
| **Scalability** | 4 | Excellent scalability benefits through deduplication and improved cache efficiency |

**Overall Recommendation**: âœ… **RECOMMENDED** - Essential for web-scale systems processing URLs, providing significant benefits in storage and caching efficiency.

### Key Design Decisions

**Process Steps:**
- Initialize system
- Process requests
- Handle responses
- Manage failures
