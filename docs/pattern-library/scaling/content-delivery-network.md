# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

## The Complete Blueprint

Content Delivery Networks revolutionize web performance by caching and serving your content from edge locations distributed globally, dramatically reducing latency and improving user experience. Instead of forcing a user in Sydney to wait for images to load from a server in New York (300ms+ latency), CDNs place cached copies at edge servers near every major population center, delivering content in under 50ms.

This pattern transforms how content reaches users by creating a global network of intelligent caches that automatically replicate, optimize, and serve your static assets, dynamic content, and even API responses from the location closest to each user. When Netflix delivers 4K video streams globally, when e-commerce sites load product images instantly worldwide, or when news sites handle traffic spikes during breaking news, they're leveraging CDN networks that can serve petabytes of content with millisecond latency.
