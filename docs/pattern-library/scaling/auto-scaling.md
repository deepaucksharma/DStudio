# Auto-scaling Pattern

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Dynamic resource scaling that adapts to demand patterns** ‚Ä¢ Uber, Netflix, Spotify proven at scale
    
    Powerful for handling variable workloads but requires careful tuning to avoid oscillation and cold start issues. Success depends on proper metrics selection, threshold configuration, and cooldown management.
    
    **Best For:** Cloud-native applications with predictable or measurable load patterns requiring cost optimization

## Essential Question

**How do we automatically adjust system capacity to match fluctuating demand while minimizing costs and maintaining performance?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Variable load patterns | >3x daily traffic variation | 20-60% cost savings through right-sizing |
| Cloud-native architecture | Stateless microservices | Automatic capacity adjustment |
| Cost optimization pressure | Budget constraints | Eliminate over-provisioning waste |
| Predictable scaling patterns | Business hours, seasonal spikes | Proactive resource management |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Constant load (<20% variation) | No benefit, adds complexity | Fixed capacity provisioning |
| Stateful services | Data consistency issues | Manual scaling with coordination |
| Sub-minute response requirements | Scale-up delay too high | Over-provision with buffer |
| Complex dependencies | Coordinated scaling needed | Orchestrated manual scaling |

### The Story
Imagine a restaurant that automatically adds tables during busy hours and removes them when quiet. Auto-scaling works similarly - when your application sees increased traffic (hungry customers), it automatically spins up more servers (adds tables). When traffic decreases, it removes unnecessary servers to save money, just like the restaurant storing unused tables.

    style C fill:#45b7d1,stroke:#3a9bc1
```

### Core Insight
> **Key Takeaway:** Auto-scaling automatically matches resource capacity to actual demand, reducing costs during low usage while maintaining performance during spikes.

### In One Sentence
Auto-scaling monitors system metrics and automatically adds or removes compute resources based on predefined thresholds to optimize cost and performance.

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without This Pattern</h4>

**E-commerce Company, 2020**: During Black Friday, their fixed-capacity system couldn't handle 10x normal traffic. Customer checkout failures lasted 4 hours, resulting in $5M lost sales. Meanwhile, during off-peak hours, they paid for 80% unused server capacity year-round, wasting $200K annually.

**Impact**: $5M revenue loss, 80% resource waste, poor customer experience

```

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Metrics Collection | Monitor system health | Track CPU, memory, request rate, latency |
| Decision Engine | Evaluate scaling rules | Apply thresholds and cooldown logic |
| Infrastructure Manager | Execute scaling actions | Launch/terminate instances, update load balancer |
| Health Checks | Validate instance readiness | Ensure new instances are serving traffic |

### Basic Example

```python
# Auto-scaling core concept
def auto_scaling_logic():
    """Shows essential auto-scaling decision flow"""
    # 1. Collect current metrics
    cpu_usage = get_average_cpu_usage()
    instance_count = get_current_instances()
    
    # 2. Apply scaling rules
    if cpu_usage > 80 and not in_cooldown():
        scale_out(instance_count * 1.5)  # 50% increase
    elif cpu_usage < 30 and instance_count > min_instances:
        scale_in(instance_count * 0.8)   # 20% decrease
    
    # 3. Start cooldown period
    start_cooldown(minutes=5)
```

    [*] --> Monitoring
    Monitoring --> Evaluating: Metrics Collected
    Evaluating --> Scaling: Threshold Breached
    Evaluating --> Monitoring: Within Range
    Scaling --> Provisioning: Scale Decision Made
    Provisioning --> Cooldown: Instances Changed
    Cooldown --> Monitoring: Period Expired
    
    Provisioning --> Failed: Infrastructure Error

```

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Scaling Metric** | CPU vs Request Rate | CPU: Simple<br>Request Rate: More accurate | Request rate for web apps |
| **Scaling Speed** | Conservative vs Aggressive | Conservative: Slower but stable<br>Aggressive: Fast but risky | Start conservative, tune based on data |
| **Instance Type** | Uniform vs Mixed | Uniform: Simple<br>Mixed: Cost optimized | Mixed with spot instances |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Scaling Too Quickly**: Aggressive thresholds cause flapping ‚Üí Use appropriate cooldown periods (5-10 minutes)
2. **Wrong Metrics**: CPU doesn't reflect application load ‚Üí Use request rate or queue depth for better accuracy
3. **No Maximum Limits**: Runaway scaling costs ‚Üí Always set reasonable max instance limits
</div>

### Production Considerations

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Range | Optimization Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Scale-up Time | 2-5 minutes | <3 minutes including cold start |
| Scale-down Time | 5-10 minutes | Conservative to avoid oscillation |
| Metric Collection | 30-60 seconds | Balance responsiveness vs overhead |
| Cost Reduction | 20-60% | Depends on load variation |
