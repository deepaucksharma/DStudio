# Rate Limiting Pattern

!!! success "üèÜ Gold Standard Pattern"
    **Request flow control that prevents abuse while maintaining system availability** ‚Ä¢ Stripe, Twitter, GitHub proven at scale
    
    Rate limiting prevents system overload, ensures fair resource usage, and protects against DoS attacks. Essential for any public-facing API or service, providing the first line of defense against abuse.
    
    **Key Success Metrics:**
    - Stripe: Billions of API requests protected with sophisticated fair queuing
    - Twitter: 500M+ tweets/day with per-endpoint rate limiting  
    - GitHub: 100M+ developers managed with cost-based quotas

## Essential Question

**How do we protect our systems from overload while ensuring fair access to resources across users and clients?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Public-facing APIs | REST/GraphQL endpoints | Prevent abuse and ensure availability |
| Expensive operations | AI/ML inference, report generation | Control resource consumption costs |
| Multi-tenant systems | SaaS platforms, shared services | Fair resource allocation across tenants |
| DDoS protection | All external services | First line of defense against attacks |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Internal trusted microservices | Adds unnecessary latency | Circuit breakers for failure protection |
| Batch processing systems | Not request-based paradigm | Resource quotas and scheduling |
| Event streaming systems | Different flow control model | Backpressure mechanisms |
| Emergency/health endpoints | Must always be available | Separate infrastructure tier |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min) {#intuition}

### The Story
Imagine a popular restaurant that can serve 100 customers per hour. Without reservations or waiting limits, 1000 people might show up during lunch, creating chaos and poor service for everyone. Rate limiting is like a reservation system - it controls how many requests (customers) can access your service (restaurant) within a time window, ensuring quality service for legitimate users.

```

### Core Insight
> **Key Takeaway:** Rate limiting trades some request acceptance for system stability, protecting your service from being overwhelmed while maintaining predictable performance.

### In One Sentence
Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make within a time window, preventing system overload while ensuring fair resource access across users.

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without This Pattern</h4>

**API Company, 2020**: A single malicious client sent 1 million requests per minute to their public API, overwhelming database connections and causing 3-hour outage for all 50,000 legitimate users. Lost revenue: $500K. Implementation of rate limiting the following month reduced attack impact to <30 seconds and prevented all subsequent overload incidents.

**Impact**: 3-hour outage, $500K revenue loss, 50,000 affected users
</div>

### How It Works

#### Architecture Overview
#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Rate Limiter | Request evaluation | Apply rate limiting algorithms and rules |
| Token Store | State management | Track request counts and quotas per client |
| Quota Manager | Policy enforcement | Manage different limits for users/tiers/operations |
| Monitoring | Observability | Track metrics and adjust thresholds |

### Implementation Details

#### State Management
#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Algorithm Choice** | Token Bucket vs Sliding Window | Token Bucket: Burst support<br>Sliding Window: Precise control | Token bucket for APIs, sliding window for precision |
| **Storage Layer** | In-memory vs Redis | In-memory: Fast but local<br>Redis: Shared but network overhead | Redis for distributed systems |
| **Granularity** | Global vs Per-user vs Per-IP | Global: Simple<br>Per-user: Fair<br>Per-IP: Abuse protection | Multi-tier approach |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Fixed Limits Only**: Static limits can't adapt to different usage patterns ‚Üí Implement tiered limits based on user behavior
2. **No Retry Guidance**: Clients don't know when to retry ‚Üí Always include Retry-After headers
3. **Clock Synchronization**: Distributed systems have timing issues ‚Üí Use logical timestamps or centralized time
</div>

### Production Considerations

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Range | Optimization Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Rate Limiter Latency | 1-10ms | <5ms for in-memory, <20ms for Redis |
| Rejection Rate | 1-5% normal traffic | <1% for legitimate users |
| Memory per User | 1-100KB | Depends on algorithm and window size |
| Accuracy | 95-99% | Balance with performance requirements |

## Level 4: Expert (20 min) {#expert}

### Advanced Techniques

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Hierarchical Rate Limiting**
   - When to apply: Complex applications with multiple resource constraints
   - Impact: Granular control prevents abuse while allowing normal usage
   - Trade-off: Configuration complexity vs precise control

2. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**
   - When to apply: Variable capacity systems or dynamic threat response
   - Impact: Automatically adjusts limits based on system health
   - Trade-off: Implementation complexity vs automatic optimization

### Scaling Considerations

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Dashboard Panel |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Request Rate | >80% of capacity | Requests per second by endpoint |
| Rejection Rate | >5% for legitimate users | Rate limit violations by client |
| Latency Impact | >10ms p99 overhead | Rate limiter performance |
| False Positives | >1% legitimate requests blocked | Client behavior analysis |

### Real-World Case Studies

#### Case Study 1: GitHub's GraphQL Rate Limiting

<div class="truth-box">
<h4>üí° Production Insights from GitHub</h4>

**Challenge**: GraphQL queries vary dramatically in complexity and cost, making traditional request-based rate limiting ineffective

**Implementation**: 
- Cost-based rate limiting where each field/operation has a cost
- Personal access tokens get 5000 points/hour
- Complex queries consume more points than simple ones
- Rate limit headers include cost information for client optimization

**Results**: 
- API Abuse: 99.9% reduction in resource-intensive query abuse
- Fair Usage: Complex operations properly limited without blocking simple queries
- Developer Experience: Clear cost feedback helps optimize client queries
- System Stability: GraphQL endpoint maintains consistent performance

**Lessons Learned**: Cost-based limiting is essential for variable-complexity operations; transparent cost calculation helps developers optimize usage
