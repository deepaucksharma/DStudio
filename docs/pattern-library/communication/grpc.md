# gRPC Pattern

!!! success "üèÜ Gold Standard Pattern"
    **High-Performance RPC** ‚Ä¢ Google, Netflix, Uber proven at billions of RPCs/second
    
    The modern standard for service-to-service communication. gRPC provides efficient binary serialization, streaming, and multiplexing over HTTP/2, making it ideal for microservices architectures.
    
    **Key Success Metrics:**
    - Google: Billions of RPCs/second powering all internal services
    - Netflix: 10x throughput increase over REST with 75% latency reduction
    - Uber: Millions of concurrent streams for real-time location updates

## Essential Question

**How do we achieve high-performance, type-safe service-to-service communication?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Internal microservices | High-frequency service-to-service calls | 10x throughput vs REST, 75% latency reduction |
| Real-time streaming | Live location updates, chat messages | 4 streaming patterns vs request-response |
| Polyglot systems | Services in Go, Java, Python, C++ | Type-safe contracts across languages |
| Mobile/IoT backends | Bandwidth-constrained environments | 90% smaller payloads vs JSON |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Browser clients | No native browser support | [WebSocket](/pattern-library/communication/websocket/) or gRPC-Web |
| Public APIs | Binary protocol not human-readable | REST with OpenAPI |
| Simple CRUD operations | Overkill complexity | REST for straightforward operations |
| Debugging with curl | Binary protocol not curl-friendly | HTTP/JSON for troubleshooting ease |

### The Story

Imagine a high-speed train system (gRPC) vs traditional mail delivery (REST). The train system uses dedicated tracks (HTTP/2), efficient packaging (Protocol Buffers), and can carry multiple cars simultaneously (multiplexing). It's faster and more efficient, but requires special infrastructure.

### Core Insight

> **Key Takeaway:** gRPC trades human readability for performance by using binary Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2, achieving 10x throughput improvements while maintaining type safety.

### In One Sentence

gRPC **achieves high-performance communication** by **using binary Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2** to **enable efficient, type-safe service interactions with streaming support**.

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without This Pattern</h4>

**Microservices Company, 2020**: 50+ microservices using REST/JSON for internal communication. Peak traffic caused cascading failures due to JSON parsing overhead and HTTP/1.1 connection limits. Response times degraded from 50ms to 2000ms.

**Impact**: 99.5% ‚Üí 90% availability drop, $3M revenue loss during traffic spike, 6-hour recovery time
</div>

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Protocol Buffers | Serialization | Binary encoding/decoding with schema |
| HTTP/2 Transport | Connection management | Multiplexing, flow control, compression |
| Generated Stubs | Type safety | Client/server code generation |
| Stream Manager | Flow control | Handle 4 streaming patterns |

### Basic Example

**Process Overview:** See production implementations for details

# user_service.proto
syntax = "proto3";

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (User);
  rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (stream User);
  rpc CreateUsers(stream CreateUserRequest) returns (CreateUsersResponse);
  rpc Chat(stream ChatMessage) returns (stream ChatMessage);
}

message User {
  int64 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  int64 created_at = 4;
}

# Python implementation
import grpc
import user_service_pb2_grpc as user_pb2_grpc
import user_service_pb2 as user_pb2

class UserService(user_pb2_grpc.UserServiceServicer):
    def GetUser(self, request, context):
        """Unary RPC - single request, single response"""
        user = self.db.get_user(request.id)
        return user_pb2.User(
            id=user.id,
            name=user.name,
            email=user.email,
            created_at=int(user.created_at.timestamp())
        )
    
    def ListUsers(self, request, context):
        """Server streaming - single request, multiple responses"""
        for user in self.db.list_users(request.limit):
            yield user_pb2.User(
                id=user.id,
                name=user.name,
                email=user.email,
                created_at=int(user.created_at.timestamp())
            )
    
    def CreateUsers(self, request_iterator, context):
        """Client streaming - multiple requests, single response"""
        created_count = 0
        for user_request in request_iterator:
            self.db.create_user(user_request)
            created_count += 1
        
        return user_pb2.CreateUsersResponse(count=created_count)

# Client usage
def use_grpc_client():
    with grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051') as channel:
        stub = user_pb2_grpc.UserServiceStub(channel)
        
        # Unary call
        user = stub.GetUser(user_pb2.GetUserRequest(id=123))
        print(f"User: {user.name}")
        
        # Server streaming
        for user in stub.ListUsers(user_pb2.ListUsersRequest(limit=10)):
            print(f"Streamed user: {user.name}")
