# Service Registry Pattern

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Central Service Governance** ‚Ä¢ Netflix Eureka, HashiCorp Consul, Kubernetes proven
    
    Service Registry provides centralized service contract management but requires careful governance to prevent schema drift. Essential for complex microservice architectures with strict API contracts.
    
    **Best For:** Large-scale microservices requiring contract governance and dependency management

## Essential Question

**How do we maintain authoritative metadata about service contracts and dependencies across a distributed system?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Complex service dependencies | 50+ microservices with interdependencies | Clear dependency tracking prevents cascading failures |
| Multi-team environments | Teams need to discover and integrate services | Shared contracts reduce integration time by 60% |
| API governance requirements | Banking system needing strict contract validation | Prevents breaking changes from reaching production |
| Schema evolution needs | Services evolving with backward compatibility | Safe schema migrations with impact analysis |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Simple service architectures | < 10 services with minimal interdependencies | [Service Discovery](service-discovery.md) |
| Same-team ownership | All services owned by single team | Direct configuration management |
| Rapid prototyping | Need fast iteration without governance | Embedded service metadata |
| Simple request-response | Basic API calls without complex contracts | [API Gateway](api-gateway.md) routing |

## Level 1: Intuition (5 min) {#intuition}

### The Story

Imagine a large enterprise directory system. Just as employees need to know who does what, when they're available, and how to contact them, services in a distributed system need comprehensive metadata about other services‚Äîtheir contracts, versions, dependencies, and capabilities.

### Visual Metaphor

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Service Registry (Corporate Directory)"
        R[Registry Database]
        R --> M[Service Metadata]
        R --> S[API Schemas]
        R --> D[Dependencies]
        R --> V[Version History]
    end
    
    subgraph "Services (Employees)"
        S1[User Service] -->|Register Profile| R
        S2[Order Service] -->|Register Profile| R
        S3[Payment Service] -->|Register Profile| R
    end
    
    subgraph "Consumers (Other Employees)"
        C1[API Gateway] -->|Lookup Contacts| R
        C2[Service Mesh] -->|Find Dependencies| R
        C3[Developer Portal] -->|Generate Docs| R
    end
    
    style R fill:#5448C8,stroke:#3f33a6,color:#fff,stroke-width:3px
    style M fill:#00BCD4,stroke:#0097a7,color:#fff
    style S fill:#00BCD4,stroke:#0097a7,color:#fff
    style D fill:#00BCD4,stroke:#0097a7,color:#fff
    style V fill:#00BCD4,stroke:#0097a7,color:#fff
```

### Core Insight

> **Key Takeaway:** Service Registry is the "phone book" of distributed systems‚Äîit stores not just who's available, but their complete professional profile including capabilities, contracts, and relationships.

### In One Sentence

Service Registry **centralizes service metadata** by **storing contracts, schemas, and dependencies** to achieve **consistent service governance and safe evolution**.

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min) {#foundation}

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without This Pattern</h4>

**E-commerce Company, 2022**: 120 microservices with no central registry. Teams hard-coded service URLs and API contracts. When payment service changed its schema, 15 dependent services broke in production. Took 8 hours to identify all affected services and deploy fixes.

**Impact**: $2.3M revenue loss, 40-hour engineering effort, customer trust damaged

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Registry Database | Central storage | Service metadata, schemas, dependency graph |
| Schema Manager | Contract validation | API schema versioning and compatibility checks |
| Version Manager | Evolution tracking | Service lifecycle and version management |
| Discovery Bridge | Runtime integration | Sync with service discovery systems |

### Basic Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class ServiceMetadata:
    name: str
    version: str
    description: str
    owner_team: str
    api_schema: dict
    dependencies: List[str]
    endpoints: List[dict]
    
class ServiceRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = {}  # service_name -> versions -> metadata
        
    def register_service(self, metadata: ServiceMetadata):
        """Register service with metadata"""
        service_name = metadata.name
        version = metadata.version
        
        if service_name not in self.services:
            self.services[service_name] = {}
        
        self.services[service_name][version] = metadata
        return f"Registered {service_name} v{version}"
    
    def get_service(self, name: str, version: str = None) -> Optional[ServiceMetadata]:
        """Get service metadata by name and version"""
        if name not in self.services:
            return None
            
        if version:
            return self.services[name].get(version)
        
        # Return latest version
        versions = sorted(self.services[name].keys(), reverse=True)
        return self.services[name][versions[0]] if versions else None
```

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Storage Backend | SQL Database<br>NoSQL Document Store | SQL: ACID, complex queries<br>NoSQL: Flexible schema, scale | SQL for governance-heavy environments |
| Schema Validation | Strict enforcement<br>Advisory warnings | Strict: Prevents errors<br>Advisory: Faster deployment | Strict for production systems |
| Versioning Strategy | Semantic versioning<br>Git-based versioning | SemVer: Clear compatibility<br>Git: Complete history | SemVer for API contracts |
| Sync with Discovery | Real-time sync<br>Periodic batch sync | Real-time: Always current<br>Batch: Lower overhead | Real-time for critical services |

### Common Pitfalls

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Mistakes</h4>

1. **Manual Registry Updates**: Leads to schema drift ‚Üí Automate via CI/CD pipelines
2. **No Breaking Change Detection**: Breaks dependent services ‚Üí Implement compatibility validation
3. **Single Registry Instance**: Creates SPOF ‚Üí Deploy with high availability and backups
4. **Ignoring Dependencies**: Creates hidden coupling ‚Üí Maintain and validate dependency graph
</div>

### Production Considerations

#### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Range | Optimization Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Query Latency | 10-50ms | < 20ms for 95th percentile |
| Registration Time | 100-500ms | < 200ms with validation |

## Level 4: Expert (20 min) {#expert}

### Advanced Techniques

#### 1. Contract Testing Integration

```python
class ContractRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contracts = {}
        self.test_results = {}
    
    def register_contract(self, provider: str, consumer: str, contract: dict):
        """Register consumer-provider contract"""
        key = f"{provider}:{consumer}"
        self.contracts[key] = contract
        
    def validate_contracts(self, provider: str, provider_version: str):
        """Run contract tests for all consumers"""
        results = {}
        for key, contract in self.contracts.items():
            if key.startswith(f"{provider}:"):
                consumer = key.split(":")[1]
                # Run Pact verification
                result = self._run_contract_test(provider, provider_version, consumer, contract)
                results[consumer] = result
        return results
    
    def _run_contract_test(self, provider: str, version: str, consumer: str, contract: dict):
        """Execute contract validation (simplified)"""
        # In production: integrate with Pact Broker or similar
        return {"status": "passed", "details": "Contract validated"}
```

#### 2. Dependency Impact Analysis

```python
import networkx as nx

class DependencyAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()
    
    def add_dependency(self, service: str, dependency: str):
        """Add service dependency to graph"""
        self.graph.add_edge(service, dependency)
    
    def analyze_impact(self, service: str) -> dict:
        """Analyze impact of changing a service"""
        # Find all services that depend on this service
        dependents = list(self.graph.predecessors(service))
        
        # Calculate cascade depth
        cascade_levels = {}
        for dependent in dependents:
            cascade_levels[dependent] = nx.shortest_path_length(
                self.graph, dependent, service
            )
        
        return {
            "direct_dependents": dependents,
            "cascade_depth": max(cascade_levels.values()) if cascade_levels else 0,
            "total_affected": len(cascade_levels)
        }
```

### Scaling Considerations

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Small Scale (< 20 services)"
        A1[Single Registry]
        A1 --> A2[File-based Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Medium Scale (20-100 services)"
        B1[Primary Registry]
        B2[Backup Registry]
        B3[Database Cluster]
        B1 --> B3
        B2 --> B3
    end
    
    subgraph "Large Scale (100+ services)"
        C1[Registry Cluster]
        C2[Global Load Balancer]
        C3[Regional Replicas]
        C4[CDN Cache]
        C2 --> C1
        C1 --> C3
        C3 --> C4
    end
    
    A1 -->|20 services| B1
    B1 -->|100 services| C1
```

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Dashboard Panel |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Registry Query Latency | > 100ms p95 | Latency distribution chart |
| Schema Validation Failures | > 5% failure rate | Error rate over time |
| Dependency Graph Depth | > 5 levels deep | Network topology view |
| Stale Service Registrations | > 24 hours old | Staleness heatmap |
