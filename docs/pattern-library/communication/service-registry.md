# Service Registry Pattern

!!! info "ü•à Silver Tier Pattern"
    **Central Service Governance** ‚Ä¢ Netflix Eureka, HashiCorp Consul, Kubernetes proven
    
    Service Registry provides centralized service contract management but requires careful governance to prevent schema drift. Essential for complex microservice architectures with strict API contracts.
    
    **Best For:** Large-scale microservices requiring contract governance and dependency management

## Essential Question

**How do we maintain authoritative metadata about service contracts and dependencies across a distributed system?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### ‚úÖ Use When

| Scenario | Example | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Complex service dependencies | 50+ microservices with interdependencies | Clear dependency tracking prevents cascading failures |
| Multi-team environments | Teams need to discover and integrate services | Shared contracts reduce integration time by 60% |
| API governance requirements | Banking system needing strict contract validation | Prevents breaking changes from reaching production |
| Schema evolution needs | Services evolving with backward compatibility | Safe schema migrations with impact analysis |

### ‚ùå DON'T Use When

| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Simple service architectures | < 10 services with minimal interdependencies | [Service Discovery](communication/service-discovery.md) |
| Same-team ownership | All services owned by single team | Direct configuration management |
| Rapid prototyping | Need fast iteration without governance | Embedded service metadata |
| Simple request-response | Basic API calls without complex contracts | [API Gateway](communication/api-gateway.md) routing |

### The Story

Imagine a large enterprise directory system. Just as employees need to know who does what, when they're available, and how to contact them, services in a distributed system need comprehensive metadata about other services‚Äîtheir contracts, versions, dependencies, and capabilities.

### Core Insight

> **Key Takeaway:** Service Registry is the "phone book" of distributed systems‚Äîit stores not just who's available, but their complete professional profile including capabilities, contracts, and relationships.

### In One Sentence

Service Registry **centralizes service metadata** by **storing contracts, schemas, and dependencies** to achieve **consistent service governance and safe evolution**.

### The Problem Space

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>üö® What Happens Without This Pattern</h4>

**E-commerce Company, 2022**: 120 microservices with no central registry. Teams hard-coded service URLs and API contracts. When payment service changed its schema, 15 dependent services broke in production. Took 8 hours to identify all affected services and deploy fixes.

**Impact**: $2.3M revenue loss, 40-hour engineering effort, customer trust damaged
</div>

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Registry Database | Central storage | Service metadata, schemas, dependency graph |
| Schema Manager | Contract validation | API schema versioning and compatibility checks |
| Version Manager | Evolution tracking | Service lifecycle and version management |
| Discovery Bridge | Runtime integration | Sync with service discovery systems |

### Basic Example

**Process Overview:** See production implementations for details

    def register_service(self, metadata: ServiceMetadata):
        """Register service with metadata"""
        service_name = metadata.name
        version = metadata.version
        
        if service_name not in self.services:
            self.services[service_name] = {}
        
        self.services[service_name][version] = metadata
        return f"Registered {service_name} v{version}"
    
    def get_service(self, name: str, version: str = None) -> Optional[ServiceMetadata]:
        """Get service metadata by name and version"""
        if name not in self.services:
            return None
            
        if version:
            return self.services[name].get(version)
        
        # Return latest version
        versions = sorted(self.services[name].keys(), reverse=True)
        return self.services[name][versions[0]] if versions else None

### Implementation

**Key Concepts:** Pattern implemented in production systems like etcd, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.

#### Critical Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Trade-off | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Storage Backend | SQL Database<br>NoSQL Document Store | SQL: ACID, complex queries<br>NoSQL: Flexible schema, scale | SQL for governance-heavy environments |
| Schema Validation | Strict enforcement<br>Advisory warnings | Strict: Prevents errors<br>Advisory: Faster deployment | Strict for production systems |
| Versioning Strategy | Semantic versioning<br>Git-based versioning | SemVer: Clear compatibility<br>Git: Complete history | SemVer for API contracts |
| Sync with Discovery | Real-time sync<br>Periodic batch sync | Real-time: Always current<br>Batch: Lower overhead | Real-time for critical services |

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Complexity** | 4 | Complex schema management, versioning, dependency tracking, and governance processes |
| **Performance Impact** | 3 | Improves development velocity and prevents runtime errors but adds lookup overhead |
| **Operational Overhead** | 4 | Requires governance processes, schema validation, registry maintenance, and sync management |
| **Team Expertise Required** | 4 | Deep understanding of API design, schema evolution, and service lifecycle management |
| **Scalability** | 3 | Scales for metadata management but can become bottleneck without proper architecture |

**Overall Recommendation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **USE WITH EXPERTISE** - Essential for complex microservice environments but requires strong governance and operational discipline.
