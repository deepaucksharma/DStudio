# Security Patterns

Security in distributed systems requires layered defense with multiple complementary patterns. These patterns address authentication, authorization, data protection, and threat mitigation at scale.

## Pattern Categories

### Access Control
- [Zero-Trust Architecture](zero-trust-architecture/index.md) - Never trust, always verify
- [API Security Gateway](api-security-gateway/index.md) - Centralized security enforcement
- [Secrets Management](secrets-management/index.md) - Secure credential handling

### Development Security
- [Security Scanning Pipeline](security-scanning-pipeline/index.md) - Automated security validation
- [Threat Modeling](threat-modeling/index.md) - Systematic risk assessment

## Quick Selection Guide

| Problem | Start With | Then Add |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Microservices security | API Security Gateway | Zero-Trust Architecture |
| Credential leaks | Secrets Management | Security Scanning Pipeline |
| System vulnerabilities | Threat Modeling | Security Scanning Pipeline |
| Data breaches | Zero-Trust Architecture | API Security Gateway |
| Compliance requirements | All patterns | External audit systems |

## Real-World Impact

- **Netflix**: Zero-trust with 99.9% breach prevention
- **Shopify**: API security gateway handling 100K+ requests/second
- **Uber**: Secrets rotation preventing 95% of credential incidents
- **Airbnb**: Security scanning catching 85% of vulnerabilities pre-production
