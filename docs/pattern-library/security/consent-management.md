# Consent Management

!!! info "Pattern Overview"
    **Category**: security  
    **Complexity**: Medium  
    **Use Cases**: privacy compliance, user consent, data protection

## Problem

Privacy regulations like GDPR require explicit user consent for data processing. Managing consent across multiple services, tracking changes, and ensuring compliance is complex and legally critical.

## Solution

Consent management systems provide centralized consent collection, storage, and enforcement. They track consent history, enable granular permissions, and integrate with downstream systems.

## Implementation

```python
# Example implementation
class ConsentManager:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def execute(self):
        # Implementation details
        pass
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Provides regulatory compliance
- Enables centralized consent tracking
- Improves audit trail maintenance

**Cons:**
- Increases implementation complexity
- Requires performance overhead
- May impact integration requirements

## When to Use

- When you need GDPR/CCPA compliance
- For systems that require data-driven businesses
- In scenarios with user privacy requirements
