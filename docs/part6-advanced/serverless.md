## Introduction

<div class="serverless-intro">

Serverless computing represents a fundamental shift in how we think about distributed systems. By abstracting away server management, it forces us to reconsider our assumptions about state, latency, and system boundaries.

**Key Paradigm Shifts:**
- From long-running processes to ephemeral functions
- From managing infrastructure to managing code
- From centralized compute to edge-native architectures
- From capacity planning to automatic scaling

## Core Concepts

!!! construction "Coming Soon"
    This chapter is under development. Topics to be covered:
    
    ### Serverless Fundamentals
    - Function as a Service (FaaS)
    - Backend as a Service (BaaS)
    - Event-driven architectures
    - Stateless design patterns
    
    ### Edge Computing
    - CDN compute
    - IoT edge processing
    - 5G edge applications
    - Distributed inference
    
    ### Challenges & Solutions
    - Cold start optimization
    - State management strategies
    - Distributed tracing
    - Cost optimization
    
    ### Real-World Case Studies
