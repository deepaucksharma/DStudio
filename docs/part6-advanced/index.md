## How Axioms Apply

<div class="axiom-application">

Even in these cutting-edge domains, our fundamental axioms still govern:

| Advanced Topic | Dominant Axioms | Key Challenges |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Serverless | Latency (cold starts), Economics (pay-per-use) | State management, debugging |
| ML Systems | Capacity (GPU limits), Coordination (distributed training) | Data consistency, versioning |
| Blockchain | Coordination (consensus), Truth (Byzantine fault tolerance) | Scalability, energy usage |
| Multi-cloud | Latency (cross-cloud), Failure (provider outages) | Complexity, cost management |
| Quantum | Trust (cryptography), Time (key rotation) | Algorithm migration, compatibility |
| Streaming | Ordering (event time), Capacity (backpressure) | Exactly-once, state management |
