## Introduction

<div class="ml-intro">

Machine learning systems are distributed systems with additional complexity: they must handle massive data volumes, coordinate distributed training, serve real-time predictions, and manage model lifecycles—all while maintaining reproducibility and fairness.

**Unique Challenges:**
- Data parallel and model parallel training
- Feature stores and data pipelines
- Online learning and concept drift
- GPU/TPU resource management
- Model versioning and A/B testing
