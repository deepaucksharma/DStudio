## Overview

Incident response is a critical discipline in distributed systems that focuses on rapidly detecting, analyzing, and resolving system failures and performance issues. This comprehensive framework encompasses structured processes for incident detection, escalation procedures, communication protocols, and post-incident review mechanisms to continuously improve system reliability and organizational response capabilities.


## Prerequisites

Before implementing incident response procedures, ensure you have established monitoring and alerting systems, defined clear escalation paths, identified key stakeholders and their contact information, documented system architecture and dependencies, and created communication channels for incident coordination. Teams should also have access to debugging tools, logging systems, and rollback mechanisms.


## Steps

Effective incident response follows a structured approach: immediate incident detection and classification, rapid team assembly and communication, systematic investigation and diagnosis, implementation of containment measures, root cause analysis, resolution deployment, and comprehensive post-incident documentation and review processes.
