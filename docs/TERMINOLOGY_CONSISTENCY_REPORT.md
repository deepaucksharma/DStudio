# Terminology Consistency Report

## Summary
This report documents the terminology consistency review and updates performed on the DStudio documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Axiom to Law Terminology Update
- **Scope**: All non-archive files in the documentation
- **Changes**:
  - Updated "axiom" references to "law" throughout the documentation
  - Renamed folder structure from `axiomX-name` to `lawX-name` format
  - Updated all internal links to use the new law folder structure
  - Changed CSS class from `axiom-box` to `law-box` where used

### 2. Folder Restructuring
**Before:**
```
part1-axioms/
├── axiom1-failure/
├── axiom2-asynchrony/
├── axiom3-emergence/
├── axiom4-tradeoffs/
├── axiom5-epistemology/
├── axiom6-human-api/
└── axiom7-economics/
```

**After:**
```
part1-axioms/
├── law1-failure/
├── law2-asynchrony/
├── law3-emergence/
├── law4-tradeoffs/
├── law5-epistemology/
├── law6-human-api/
└── law7-economics/
```

### 3. Files Updated
The following files had axiom references updated to law references:
- `/docs/index.md` - Updated homepage link
- `/docs/axioms/index.md` - Updated all law navigation links
- `/docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md` - Updated all law references
- `/docs/part2-pillars/state/index.md` - Updated law links
- `/docs/part2-pillars/work/index.md` - Updated law links
- `/docs/part2-pillars/truth/index.md` - Updated law links
- `/docs/learning-paths/index.md` - Updated law links
- `/docs/test-plan/navigation-test-plan.md` - Updated test references
- `/docs/human-factors/*.md` - Updated prerequisites
- `/docs/patterns/index.md` - Updated terminology
- `/docs/part2-pillars/pattern-catalog-intro.md` - Updated terminology
- `/docs/part2-pillars/pattern-matrix.md` - Updated terminology
- `/docs/patterns/url-normalization.md` - Changed axiom-box to law-box
- `/docs/case-studies/social-media-feed.md` - Changed axiom-box to law-box

### 4. Terminology Consistency Verified

#### Microservices
- **Finding**: All instances use "microservice" or "microservices" (no hyphen)
- **Status**: ✅ Consistent - No changes needed

#### Abbreviations
- **CAP**: Used consistently, mostly in context of "CAP theorem"
- **ACID**: Used appropriately in database contexts
- **BASE**: Defined in glossary, used correctly where it appears
- **PACELC**: Used consistently as extension to CAP theorem
- **Status**: ✅ All abbreviations are properly contextualized

### 5. Archive Preservation
- The `archive-old-8-axiom-structure` folder was preserved without changes
- This maintains historical reference to the original 8-axiom structure

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation Guidelines**: Update contributing guidelines to use "law" terminology for new content
2. **Search/Replace**: Consider adding a pre-commit hook to prevent new "axiom" references (outside archives)
3. **Glossary Update**: The glossary already correctly defines "Law" instead of "Axiom"

## Validation
All changes have been tested to ensure:
- Links are not broken
- Navigation works correctly
- Terminology is consistent throughout active documentation
- Archive remains untouched for historical reference

## Completion Status
✅ All terminology updates completed successfully
✅ No broken links detected
✅ Archive preserved correctly
✅ CSS classes updated where needed
