## Overview

Performance testing is a critical discipline that evaluates how distributed systems behave under various load conditions, identifying bottlenecks, scalability limits, and performance characteristics before production deployment. This comprehensive testing methodology encompasses load testing, stress testing, endurance testing, and spike testing to ensure systems can handle expected traffic patterns while maintaining acceptable response times and resource utilization levels.


## Prerequisites

Before implementing performance testing, teams should have established monitoring infrastructure, baseline performance metrics, representative test environments, and comprehensive understanding of expected traffic patterns. Knowledge of performance testing tools, system architecture, and capacity planning principles is essential, along with access to production-like data sets and network conditions.


## Steps

Effective performance testing follows a systematic approach: defining performance requirements and success criteria, creating realistic test scenarios and data sets, establishing baseline measurements, executing different types of performance tests, analyzing results to identify bottlenecks, and implementing optimizations based on findings and performance characteristics.
