## Usage Guidelines

1. **Hands-On First**: Start with implementation, then move to theory
2. **Use Real Tools**: Docker, monitoring, load testing - not toy examples
3. **Focus on Debugging**: Engineers spend more time debugging than writing
4. **Production Context**: Every exercise should consider production concerns
5. **Provide Infrastructure**: Don't make students set up complex environments
6. **Clear Success Criteria**: Students should know when they've succeeded
7. **Build Portfolio**: Exercises should produce showcase-worthy work
