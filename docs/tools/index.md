# Interactive Tools

## Calculators and Simulators

These tools help you apply first principles to real-world scenarios.

## Available Tools

### Tool Categories

**Planning Tools** - Help design systems within axiom constraints  
**Validation Tools** - Test your assumptions against physics  
**Calculators** - Quantify trade-offs mathematically

### Coming Soon

Interactive tools are being developed to help apply the axioms:
- Physics-based latency calculators
- Capacity planning worksheets  
- Failure scenario simulators
- Cost-benefit analyzers

## How to Use

Each tool implements the mathematical foundations from the axioms. Input your system parameters to get physics-based recommendations.
