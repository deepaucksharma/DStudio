## Quick Links to Theory

Each calculator is based on solid mathematical foundations:

- **[Little's Law](quantitative/littles-law)** - Foundation for latency and throughput calculations
- **[Queueing Theory](quantitative/queueing-models)** - Models for performance analysis
- **[Availability Math](quantitative/availability-math)** - Reliability calculations
- **[CAP Theorem](part1-axioms/distributed-knowledge)** - Consistency trade-offs
- **[Universal Scalability Law](quantitative/universal-scalability)** - Scaling predictions

## How to Use These Tools

1. **Start with your requirements** - What are you trying to optimize?
2. **Input your current metrics** - Use real data from your systems
3. **Explore scenarios** - Try different configurations
4. **Validate with theory** - Check against the mathematical models
5. **Make informed decisions** - Use results to guide architecture choices

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
 Combine multiple calculators for comprehensive analysis. For example:
 
 1. Use the **Latency Calculator** to understand response times
 2. Feed results into the **Capacity Calculator** for resource planning
 3. Use both in the **Cost Optimizer** for budget analysis
