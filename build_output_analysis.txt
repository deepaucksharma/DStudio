Analyzing mkdocs build output for WARNING count:

From the mkdocs build output, I can see these WARNING lines before the mermaid2 error:

1. WARNING about pages not in nav configuration (long list)
2. Multiple WARNING lines about unrecognized relative links and missing targets

Let me manually count all the WARNING lines visible in the output.
