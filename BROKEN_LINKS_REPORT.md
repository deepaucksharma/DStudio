# Broken Links Analysis Report

## Summary

After running comprehensive link analysis and fixes:
- **Initial broken links**: 906
- **After first fix**: 848
- **After comprehensive fix**: 580
- **Reduction**: 36% of broken links fixed

## Main Issues Identified

### 1. Pattern Links Missing
Many pattern pages referenced in content don't exist:
- `/patterns/consistent-hashing` (no .md file exists)
- `/patterns/circuit-breaker` (exists as circuit-breaker.md but links expect directory)
- `/patterns/consensus` (exists as consensus.md)
- `/patterns/anti-entropy` (exists as anti-entropy.md)

### 2. Case Study Directory Structure Issues
Links expect directory structure with index.md but files exist as single .md:
- `/case-studies/netflix-chaos/` expects index.md but only netflix-chaos.md exists
- `/case-studies/social-graph/` expects index.md but only social-graph.md exists

### 3. Incorrect Path References
- Links with `../../patterns/` from case-studies should be `../patterns/`
- Links ending with `/` expecting index.md files that don't exist

### 4. Non-existent Files Referenced
Some files are referenced but don't exist at all:
- `/patterns/consistent-hashing.md`
- `/patterns/caching-strategies-strategies.md` (double suffix)
- `/case-studies/amazon-search.md`
- Various Google interview related files

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- Remove trailing slashes from links that point to .md files
- Fix the double suffix issue (caching-strategies-strategies)
- Update relative paths to be correct based on file location

### 2. Content Structure Decisions Needed
- Decide if patterns should be single .md files or directories with index.md
- Standardize case study structure (single file vs directory)
- Create missing files or update links to existing alternatives

### 3. Automated Fixes Applied
- Fixed common pattern mappings
- Redirected non-existent case studies to similar ones
- Corrected learning path references
- Fixed quantitative section links

## Next Steps

1. Run `python3 scripts/verify-links.py` to get current broken links
2. Manually review and fix remaining 580 broken links
3. Consider creating redirects or aliases for commonly broken patterns
4. Establish link conventions going forward
