   - Non-functional requirements
   - Scale projections
   - Team expertise

2. **Evaluate Patterns**
   - Match tier to maturity
   - Consider complexity
   - Assess prerequisites
   - Calculate ROI

3. **Plan Implementation**
   - Start with Gold patterns
   - Progress to Silver when needed
   - Avoid Bronze unless necessary
   - Plan migration paths

4. **Measure Success**
   - Define metrics
   - Monitor adoption
   - Track performance
   - Iterate based on results
