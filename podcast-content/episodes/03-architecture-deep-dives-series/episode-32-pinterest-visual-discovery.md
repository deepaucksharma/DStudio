## 🎬 COLD OPEN: The Infinite Scroll Challenge (0:00-8:00)

### March 2012 - Pinterest HQ, Palo Alto

*[DRAMATIC RECONSTRUCTION: Pinterest engineering war room]*

**Lead Engineer**: "We're at 11 million users and MySQL is melting. Sharding isn't working anymore."

**CTO Yash Nelapati**: "How bad is it?"

**Database Engineer**: "Home feed generation is taking 8 seconds. Users are leaving."

**Infrastructure Lead**: "We have two choices: throw 100 engineers at fixing MySQL sharding, or completely reimagine our architecture."

*[MONTAGE: Growth explosion visualization]*
- User growth: 10x in 6 months
- Pin creation: 3 million daily
- MySQL shards: Growing exponentially
- Engineer frustration: Maximum

**Narrator**: "What started as a simple idea—letting people save images they love—had become an architectural nightmare. The solution would require reimagining not just databases, but the very nature of visual discovery itself..."

## 📊 PART 1: From Pins to Platform (8:00-33:00)

### The Founding Vision (2009-2010)

**Original Architecture**:
```
2009: MVP Architecture
- Django monolith
- Single PostgreSQL database  
- Amazon S3 for images
- Users: 5,000 beta testers
```

**Ben Silbermann (Co-founder)**: "We weren't trying to build Facebook. We wanted to help people discover and do what they love. That meant images had to load instantly, boards had to be beautiful, and discovery had to feel magical."

### The First Year Struggle (2010-2011)

**Growth Challenges Timeline**:
```
2010: Public Launch
- Users: 10,000
- Infrastructure: 2 servers
- Problem: Image loading bottlenecks

Early 2011: IPhone App Launch  
- Users: 100,000
- Solution: Basic CDN implementation
- New Problem: Database queries exploding

Late 2011: Growth Spike
- Users: 1 million
- Crisis: PostgreSQL at limits
- Decision: Emergency MySQL migration
```

### The Sharding Years (2011-2015)

**Marty Weiner (Former Engineering Lead)**: "We went from 1 database to 2, then 4, then 16. By 2012, we had hundreds of MySQL shards. Every new feature meant updating the sharding logic. It was unsustainable."

**MySQL Sharding Architecture**:
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Application Layer"
        API[API Servers]
        Web[Web Servers]
    end
    
    subgraph "Routing Layer"
        Router[Shard Router<br/>User ID → Shard Mapping]
    end
    
    subgraph "MySQL Shards"
        S1[Shard 1<br/>Users 0-1M]
        S2[Shard 2<br/>Users 1M-2M]
        S3[Shard 3<br/>Users 2M-3M]
        SN[Shard N<br/>Users N-M]
    end
    
    API --> Router
    Web --> Router
    Router --> S1
    Router --> S2
    Router --> S3
    Router --> SN
```

## 🏗️ PART 2: The Data Architecture Revolution (33:00-75:00)

### Understanding Pinterest's Data Model

**Core Entities**:
```
Pins:
- 240+ billion objects
- Metadata: URL, description, board
- Visual features: 4096-dim embeddings
- Engagement signals: saves, clicks, closeups

Boards:  
- 5+ billion collections
- User-curated themes
- Collaborative capabilities
- Privacy controls

Users:
- 450+ million accounts
- Interest graphs
- Behavioral embeddings  
- Cross-device identity
```

### The TiDB Migration (2017-2020)

**Why TiDB?**:
1. **MySQL Compatible**: Minimal application changes
2. **Horizontal Scalability**: True distributed SQL
3. **ACID Compliance**: Strong consistency
4. **No Sharding Logic**: Automatic data distribution

**Migration Strategy**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Phase 1: Shadow Testing"
        MySQL[MySQL Shards] --> App[Application]
        App --> TiDB[TiDB Cluster]
        MySQL -.->|Shadow Reads| TiDB
    end
    
    subgraph "Phase 2: Dual Writes"
        App2[Application] --> MySQL2[MySQL]
        App2 --> TiDB2[TiDB]
    end
    
    subgraph "Phase 3: Cutover"
        App3[Application] --> TiDB3[TiDB Primary]
        TiDB3 -.->|Backup| MySQL3[MySQL]
    end
```

### Modern Data Architecture

**Current Stack (2024)**:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Storage Systems"
        TiDB[TiDB<br/>Transactional Data]
        Kafka[Kafka<br/>Event Streaming]
        S3[S3<br/>Image Storage]

    end
    
    TiDB --> Spark
    Kafka --> Flink
    Spark --> RocksDB
    Flink --> Cache
    RocksDB --> Vector
```

### Data Consistency Philosophy

**Eventually Consistent Where Possible**:
```python
class PinSaveOperation:
    def save_pin(self, user_id, pin_id, board_id):
        # Immediate user feedback (cached)
        self.cache.add_to_board(user_id, board_id, pin_id)
        
        # Async persistent storage
        self.queue.publish({
            'operation': 'save_pin',
            'user_id': user_id,
            'pin_id': pin_id,
            'board_id': board_id,
            'timestamp': time.now()
        })
        
        # Update ML signals (best effort)
        self.ml_pipeline.record_engagement(
            user_id, pin_id, 'save'
        )
        
        return {'status': 'saved', 'provisional': True}
```

        if cached := self.browser_cache.get(pin_id):
            return cached
            
        # Edge cache for popular content
        if self.is_popular(pin_id):
            if cached := self.edge_cache.get(pin_id):
                return self.personalize(cached, user_context)

        if cached := self.regional_cache.get(pin_id):
            return self.personalize(cached, user_context)
            
        # Local cache before database
        if cached := self.local_cache.get(pin_id):
            return cached
            
        # Finally hit database
        pin = self.database.get(pin_id)
        self.populate_caches(pin)
        return pin
```

### Augmented Reality Shopping

**AR Architecture Requirements**:
- Real-time 3D rendering
- Sub-20ms latency
- Accurate object placement
- Cross-device synchronization

**Technical Implementation**:
```python

    def place_furniture_in_room(self, room_scan, furniture_pin):
        # Process room geometry
        room_mesh = self.process_lidar_scan(room_scan)
        
        # Extract furniture 3D model
        model_3d = self.extract_3d_model(furniture_pin)
        
        # Compute optimal placement
        placement = self.compute_placement(
            room_mesh, 
            model_3d,
            constraints=['walls', 'floor', 'existing_furniture']
        )
        
        # Real-time rendering
        render_stream = self.render_ar_stream(
            room_mesh,
            model_3d,
            placement,
            lighting=self.estimate_lighting(room_scan)
        )
        
        return render_stream
```

### Generative AI Integration

**AI-Powered Creation Tools**:
1. **Idea Generation**: Text-to-board creation
2. **Style Transfer**: Apply any artistic style
3. **Content Synthesis**: Combine multiple pins
4. **Personalized Creation**: User-specific generation

### Privacy-Preserving ML

**Federated Learning Implementation**:
```python
class FederatedPinterest:
    def train_on_device(self, user_data):
        # Local model training
        local_model = self.download_base_model()
        
        # Train on user's private data
        for batch in user_data:
            local_model.train(batch)
            
        # Extract only model updates
        updates = local_model.get_weight_updates()
        
        # Differential privacy noise
        private_updates = self.add_privacy_noise(updates)
        
        # Send only updates, not data
        self.send_updates_to_server(private_updates)
```
