## üìä PART 1: The Genesis of Global Connection (8:00-33:00)

### The Dorm Room Beginning (2004-2006)

**Original Architecture**:
```
2004: Single MySQL Database
- User profiles: 1 table
- Friendships: Simple join table
- Photos: Filesystem storage
- Scale: Harvard students only
```

**Mark Zuckerberg (Archival Interview)**: "We had maybe 10,000 users and the database was already struggling. Every new feature meant slower queries. The friendship table was growing quadratically."

### The First Scaling Crisis (2006-2008)

**Infrastructure Evolution Timeline**:
```
2006: University Expansion
- Users: 12 million
- Solution: MySQL read replicas
- Problem: Replication lag causing friendship inconsistencies

2007: Platform Launch
- Users: 50 million  
- Solution: Memcached deployment
- Innovation: Cache-aside pattern for user data

2008: Global Launch
- Users: 100 million
- Crisis: Database sharding inevitable
- Decision: Build custom graph storage
```

### The TAO Genesis (2009-2013)

**Nathan Bronson (TAO Architect)**: "We realized MySQL wasn't designed for graph queries. Finding friends-of-friends was killing us. We needed something built specifically for social graphs."

**TAO Design Principles**:
1. **Objects and Associations**: Not tables and rows
2. **Graph-Native Storage**: Optimized for traversals
3. **Global Consistency**: Eventually consistent with read-after-write guarantees
4. **Cache-First Architecture**: 99.8% cache hit rate target

## üèóÔ∏è PART 2: TAO - The Social Graph Engine (33:00-75:00)

### Understanding TAO Architecture

**Core Concepts**:
```
Objects (Nodes):
- Users, Pages, Groups, Events
- Photos, Videos, Posts, Comments  
- 100+ billion objects
- Sharded by ID across regions

Associations (Edges):
- Friendships, Likes, Comments, Tags
- Directional with inverse edges
- Time-ordered per type
- 1+ trillion edges
```

### The TAO Stack

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        Web[Web Servers]
        Mobile[Mobile Apps]
        API[Graph API]
    end
    
    subgraph "TAO Cache Hierarchy"
        Leader[Leader Cache<br/>Write-through]
        Follower1[Follower Cache<br/>Region 1]
        Follower2[Follower Cache<br/>Region 2]
        Follower3[Follower Cache<br/>Region 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        MySQL1[MySQL Shard 1<br/>Objects 0-1M]
        MySQL2[MySQL Shard 2<br/>Objects 1M-2M]
        MySQL3[MySQL Shard N<br/>Objects NM+]
    end
    
    Web --> Leader
    Mobile --> Follower1
    API --> Follower2
    
    Leader --> MySQL1
    Leader --> MySQL2
    Leader --> MySQL3
    
    Follower1 -.-> Leader
    Follower2 -.-> Leader
    Follower3 -.-> Leader
```

### Query Patterns and Optimization

**Friend Feed Generation**:
```
1. Get user's friend list (1 TAO query)
2. Fetch recent posts per friend (N queries, batched)
3. Rank by EdgeRank algorithm
4. Hydrate post data (parallel fetches)
5. Apply privacy filters
6. Return personalized feed
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- P50 latency: 1.3ms
- P99 latency: 10ms
- Queries/second: 10+ billion
- Cache hit rate: 99.8%

### Consistency Model

**Read-After-Write Guarantee**:
```python
# Simplified TAO consistency flow
def create_post(user_id, content):
    # Write to leader cache and DB
    post = write_to_leader(user_id, content)
    
    # Invalidate follower caches
    invalidate_followers(user_id, post.id)
    
    # Return with cache version
    return post, cache_version

def read_post(post_id, cache_version):
    # Check local follower cache
    post = read_follower_cache(post_id)
    
    if post.version < cache_version:
        # Force read from leader
        post = read_leader_cache(post_id)
    
    return post
```

## üåç PART 3: Global Infrastructure and Memcache Fleet (75:00-105:00)

### The Memcache Revolution

**Scale Evolution**:
```
2008: 10 Memcache servers
2012: 1,000 servers, 1TB RAM total
2016: 10,000 servers, 100TB RAM
2021: 100,000+ servers, 10+ PB RAM
2024: Largest Memcache deployment in history
```

### Memcache Architecture

**Multi-Tier Caching Strategy**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Edge PoPs"
        CDN[CDN Cache<br/>Static Content]
    end
    
    subgraph "Regional Caches"
        L1[L1: Hot Data<br/>1ms latency]
        L2[L2: Warm Data<br/>5ms latency]
    end
    
    subgraph "Central Storage"
        L3[L3: Cold Data<br/>20ms latency]
        DB[(MySQL/TAO<br/>50ms latency)]
    end
    
    CDN --> L1
    L1 --> L2
    L2 --> L3
    L3 --> DB
```

### McRouter: Distributed Cache Routing

**Consistent Hashing with Replication**:
```python
class McRouter:
    def route_request(self, key):
        # Primary destination
        primary = self.consistent_hash(key)
        
        # Replica destinations for reliability
        replicas = self.get_replicas(primary, count=2)
        
        # Try primary first
        result = self.try_server(primary, key)
        
        if not result and self.should_failover:
            # Try replicas on failure
            for replica in replicas:
                result = self.try_server(replica, key)
                if result:
                    break
                    
        return result
```

### Cache Warming Strategies

**Predictive Warming**:
- User login patterns by timezone
- Friend activity correlation
- Content popularity prediction
- Event-driven warming (birthdays, holidays)

## üîê PART 4: Privacy Infrastructure at Scale (105:00-135:00)

### The Privacy Challenge

**Privacy Checker Architecture**:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Content Creation"
        Post[New Post]
        Photo[New Photo]
        Story[New Story]
    end
    
    subgraph "Privacy Engine"
        Rules[Privacy Rules<br/>Engine]
        Graph[Social Graph<br/>Analyzer]
        ML[ML Privacy<br/>Predictor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Distribution"
        Feed[News Feed]
        Search[Search Index]
        Notif[Notifications]
    end
    
    Post --> Rules
    Photo --> Rules
    Story --> Rules
    
    Rules --> Graph
    Graph --> ML
    
    ML --> Feed
    ML --> Search
    ML --> Notif
```

### Privacy Rule Evaluation

**Complex Privacy Scenarios**:
```sql
-- Simplified privacy rule example
SELECT content_id 
FROM posts
WHERE 
    -- Basic visibility
    (privacy_setting = 'public' 
    OR user_id IN (SELECT friend_id FROM friendships WHERE user_id = ?))
    
    -- Blocked users
    AND author_id NOT IN (SELECT blocked_id FROM blocks WHERE user_id = ?)
    
    -- Custom lists
    AND (
        custom_privacy_list_id IS NULL 
        OR user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM list_members WHERE list_id = custom_privacy_list_id)
    )
    
    -- Time-based restrictions
    AND (
        temporary_privacy_until IS NULL 
        OR temporary_privacy_until > NOW()
    )
```

### GDPR and Data Sovereignty

**Regional Data Architecture**:
- EU data remains in EU data centers

- 10B messages/day
- Eventually consistent

WhatsApp Acquisition (2014):
- 450M users  
- 50B messages/day
- Strong consistency required
- End-to-end encryption
```

### Unified Messaging Architecture

**Multi-Protocol Support**:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Protocols"
        MQTT[MQTT<br/>Mobile]
        WS[WebSocket<br/>Web]
        XMPP[XMPP<br/>Legacy]
    end
    
    subgraph "Message Router"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        Router[Protocol Router]
        Queue[Message Queue]
    end
    
    subgraph "Delivery Systems"
        Iris[Iris<br/>FB Messenger]
        WA[WhatsApp<br/>Backend]
        IG[Instagram<br/>Direct]
    end
    
    MQTT --> LB
    WS --> LB
    XMPP --> LB
    
    LB --> Router
    Router --> Queue
    
    Queue --> Iris
    Queue --> WA
    Queue --> IG
```

### Message Delivery Guarantees

**Exactly-Once Delivery**:
```python
class MessageDeliverySystem:
    def deliver_message(self, message):
        # Generate unique message ID
        message_id = self.generate_uuid()
        
        # Store with idempotency key
        if self.message_store.exists(message_id):
            return self.message_store.get(message_id)
        
        # Begin transaction
        with self.db.transaction():
            # Store message
            self.message_store.put(message_id, message)
            
            # Queue for delivery
            self.delivery_queue.add(message_id)
            
            # Update sender's sent count
            self.update_sent_count(message.sender_id)
            
        # Async delivery with retries
        self.async_deliver(message_id)
        
        return message_id
```

### WhatsApp's End-to-End Encryption at Scale

**Double Ratchet Implementation**:
- 2 billion users
- 100 billion messages/day

## üéØ PART 6: Crisis Management - The 2021 Outage Deep Dive (165:00-180:00)

### The Cascade Failure

**Timeline of Disaster**:
```
11:50 AM - Routine BGP configuration update initiated
11:52 AM - Backbone routers begin rejecting routes
11:54 AM - Data centers isolated from internet
11:58 AM - Complete global outage
12:15 PM - Physical access required (badge systems offline)
12:45 PM - Engineers physically in data centers
2:30 PM - Root cause identified
4:45 PM - Gradual service restoration begins
5:45 PM - Full service restored
```

### Technical Post-Mortem

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Configuration validation bug in automation system
2. BGP withdrew all routes advertising Meta's DNS servers
3. DNS servers became unreachable
4. Internal tools relied on same DNS infrastructure
5. Physical access required to fix configuration

### Architectural Improvements

**Post-Outage Changes**:
- Out-of-band management network
- DNS infrastructure independence  
- Configuration rollback mechanisms
- Automated outage detection
- Physical access protocols
