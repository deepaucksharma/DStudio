## üí° Distilled Insights

### Insight 1: [Physics/Economics/Architecture Truth]
**The Revelation**: [One sentence that changes perspective]
- **Why It Matters**: [Business impact]
- **The $X Lesson**: [Specific failure/success with cost]
- **Decision Rule**: If [condition], then [action], because [reason]

### Insight 2: [Pattern/Anti-Pattern Wisdom]
**The Revelation**: [Counterintuitive finding]
- **Breaking Point**: At [specific scale/metric], [what fails]
- **Industry Secret**: [What companies learned the hard way]
- **Migration Trigger**: When [metric] hits [threshold], abandon [pattern]

### Insight 3: [Organizational Truth]
**The Revelation**: [Human systems insight]
- **Conway's Corollary**: [How structure affects architecture]
- **The Real Constraint**: [What actually limits scale]
- **Cultural Requirement**: [Mindset needed for pattern success]

## üìä Decision Frameworks

### When to Use [Pattern/Technology]
```
IF scale < 1000 RPS AND team < 10 engineers
  THEN monolith optimal
  BECAUSE coordination overhead > benefit

IF scale > 10K RPS OR team > 50 engineers  
  THEN consider services
  BECAUSE Conway's Law forces distribution

IF downtime cost > $100K/hour
  THEN invest in redundancy
  BECAUSE 10x infrastructure cost justified
```

### Architecture Boundaries
| Scale | Architecture | Why It Changes | Cost Multiple |
|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| <100 RPS | Monolith | Simplicity wins | 1x |
| 100-1K | Modular monolith | Logical boundaries | 2x |
| 1K-10K | Services | Physical boundaries | 5x |
| 10K-100K | Cells | Blast radius control | 10x |
| >100K | Custom | Vendor limits | 20x |

## üî• Expensive Lessons

### The $[X]M [Company] Incident
**What They Thought**: [Assumption that failed]
**What Actually Happened**: [Reality that hit]
**The Insight**: [Universal truth revealed]
**Prevention**: [Specific architectural decision]

### The [Pattern] Fallacy at [Company]
**The Promise**: [What pattern claimed to solve]
**The Reality**: [Hidden cost/complexity]
**Break-Even Point**: [When pattern becomes worthwhile]
**Alternative**: [What they should have done]

---

## üí∞ Economic Truths

### The Real Cost of [Decision]
- **Visible**: $X infrastructure
- **Hidden**: $Y operational overhead
- **Opportunity**: $Z in slower development
- **Total**: [Multiple] of initial estimate

### ROI Calculations That Matter
```
Downtime cost/hour = Revenue/hour + Customer trust loss + Recovery cost
If downtime > $X/hour, then redundancy ROI positive
If downtime < $Y/hour, then accept failures cheaper
```

### Build vs Buy Threshold
- **Build if**: Core differentiator OR scale exceeds vendor limits
- **Buy if**: Commodity function AND total cost < 3 engineers
- **Partner if**: Specialized expertise AND strategic advantage

## üéØ Pattern Combinations

### Patterns That Amplify (1+1=3)
- **[Pattern A] + [Pattern B]** = [Emergent benefit]
- Example: Circuit Breaker + Bulkhead = Cascade prevention
- Threshold: Effective above [scale]

### Patterns That Conflict (1+1=0.5)
- **[Pattern X] + [Pattern Y]** = [Emergent problem]
- Example: Synchronous Saga + Geo-distribution = Timeout cascade
- Alternative: [Better combination]

## üö® Failure Patterns

### The [X] Failure Mode
**Trigger**: [Specific condition]
**Cascade**: [How it spreads]
**Business Impact**: [Downtime √ó cost/hour]
**Early Warning**: [Metric that predicts]
**Prevention**: [Architectural choice]

### Human Factors Reality
- **Alert Fatigue Threshold**: >5 alerts/day/engineer
- **Incident Response Limit**: 2 major incidents/month/team
- **Knowledge Transfer**: 6 months for new engineer productivity
- **On-Call Burnout**: 1 week/month maximum

## üìà Scale Transitions

### The [10x] Boundary
**At [previous scale]**: [What works]
**At [new scale]**: [What breaks]
**Transition Signal**: [Metric to watch]
**Migration Strategy**: [How to evolve]

### Organizational Scaling
```
<10 engineers: Everyone knows everything
10-50: Specialization required
50-200: Platform team necessary  
200-1000: Federated model only option
>1000: Multiple independent units
```
