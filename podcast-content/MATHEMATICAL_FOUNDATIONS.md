## Physics & Latency

### Speed of Light Constraint

**Formula:**
```latex
RTT_{min} = \frac{2 \times distance}{c}
```

**Plain English:** The minimum round-trip time between two points is twice the distance divided by the speed of light.

**Variables:**
- `RTT_min`: Minimum round-trip time (seconds)
- `distance`: Physical distance between points (meters)
- `c`: Speed of light in medium (~2×10⁸ m/s in fiber)

**Real-World Example:**
```
San Francisco ↔ London:
- Distance: 8,600 km
- Minimum RTT: 2 × 8,600,000m ÷ (2×10⁸ m/s) = 86ms
- Reality: 150ms (infrastructure overhead = 64ms)
- Cost of overhead: $100B annually across industry
```

**When to Use:**
- Designing global applications
- Setting realistic SLAs
- Choosing datacenter locations
- Evaluating CDN strategies

**When NOT to Use:**
- Single datacenter applications
- Satellite communications (different physics)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting infrastructure overhead (30-50ms typical)
- Using speed of light in vacuum instead of fiber
- Not accounting for routing inefficiencies

### Bandwidth-Delay Product

**Formula:**
```latex
BDP = Bandwidth \times RTT
```

**Plain English:** The amount of data "in flight" on a network connection.

**Variables:**
- `BDP`: Bandwidth-delay product (bytes)
- `Bandwidth`: Link capacity (bytes/second)
- `RTT`: Round-trip time (seconds)

**Real-World Example:**
```
Netflix streaming to user:
- Bandwidth: 25 Mbps = 3.125 MB/s
- RTT: 100ms = 0.1s
- BDP: 3.125 × 0.1 = 312.5 KB
- Buffer requirement: ≥ 312.5 KB for full utilization
```

**When to Use:**
- TCP window sizing
- Buffer allocation
- Network capacity planning

**Common Mistakes:**
- Confusing bits vs bytes
- Ignoring TCP overhead
- Not accounting for congestion control

---

## Availability & Reliability

### Basic Component Availability

**Formula:**
```latex
A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MTTR}
```

**Plain English:** Availability equals uptime divided by total time.

**Variables:**
- `A`: Availability (0-1)
- `MTTF`: Mean Time To Failure
- `MTTR`: Mean Time To Recovery

**Real-World Example:**
```
Database server:
- MTTF: 8760 hours (1 year)
- MTTR: 4 hours
- A: 8760 ÷ (8760 + 4) = 0.9995 (99.95%)
- Downtime: 4.38 hours/year
```

**When to Use:**
- Single component SLA calculations
- Maintenance window planning
- Hardware procurement decisions

**Common Mistakes:**
- Ignoring scheduled maintenance
- Not measuring actual MTTR
- Forgetting cascading failures

### Correlated Failure Availability

**Formula:**
```latex
A_{system} = \prod_{i,j} (1 - \rho_{ij}) \times p_i \times p_j
```

**Plain English:** System availability under correlated failures considers how components fail together.

**Variables:**
- `ρ_ij`: Correlation coefficient between components i and j (-1 to 1)
- `p_i`: Individual component failure probability
- `A_system`: Overall system availability

**Real-World Example:**
```
Three AWS Availability Zones:
- Individual AZ availability: 99.99% each
- Naive calculation: (0.9999)³ = 99.97%
- With ρ = 0.1 correlation: ~99.9% actual
- With ρ = 0.3 correlation: ~99.7% actual
- Reality: 2017 S3 outage took down multiple AZs
```

**When to Use:**
- Multi-region architecture design
- Understanding blast radius
- SLA negotiations
- Risk assessment

**When NOT to Use:**
- Truly independent components
- Single failure domain

**Common Mistakes:**
- Assuming independence (ρ = 0)
- Not measuring actual correlations
- Ignoring shared dependencies

### Series vs Parallel System Availability

**Formulas:**
```latex
A_{series} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} A_i

A_{parallel} = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 - A_i)
```

**Plain English:**
- **Series**: All components must work (chain is only as strong as weakest link)
- **Parallel**: At least one component must work (redundancy improves availability)

**Real-World Example:**
```
Load balancer architecture:
Series (single path):
- Load balancer: 99.9%
- App server: 99.9%
- Database: 99.9%
- Total: 0.999³ = 99.7%

Parallel (redundant):
- Two app servers: 1 - (1-0.999)² = 99.9999%
- With redundant DB: even higher
```

**When to Use:**
- Designing fault-tolerant systems
- Calculating end-to-end availability
- Justifying redundancy costs

**Common Mistakes:**
- Mixing up series and parallel formulas
- Not accounting for load balancer failures
- Ignoring human errors in failover

- `λ`: Arrival rate (items/time)
- `W`: Average time in system

**Real-World Example:**
```
Database connection pool:
- Request rate: 1000 req/sec
- Average response time: 50ms = 0.05s
- Required connections: 1000 × 0.05 = 50
- Safety factor 2x: Pool size = 100
```

**When to Use:**

```latex
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}

W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}

L = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}
```

**Plain English:** Single-server queue with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times.

**Variables:**
- `ρ`: Utilization (must be < 1)

- `L`: Average queue length

**Real-World Example:**
```
API Gateway:
- Requests arrive: 800/sec
- Service capacity: 1000/sec
- Utilization: 800/1000 = 0.8 (80%)
- Average wait: 1/(1000-800) = 5ms
- Queue length: 0.8/(1-0.8) = 4 requests

If load increases to 900/sec:
- Utilization: 90%
- Wait time: 10ms (doubled!)
- Queue length: 9 requests (more than doubled!)
```

**When to Use:**

```

**Plain English:** Probability of waiting in a multi-server queue.

**Variables:**
- `c`: Number of servers
- `ρ`: Traffic intensity per server
- `E_c`: Erlang C function value

**Real-World Example:**

- Traffic intensity: 100 × (6/60) = 10 Erlangs

With 12 agents:
- Utilization: 10/12 = 83%
- P(wait) ≈ 30%
- Average wait: 2 minutes

With 15 agents:
- Utilization: 67%

**Real-World Example:**
```
Web application scaling:
- Database writes: 10% (sequential)
- Business logic: 90% (parallel)
- S = 0.1, P = 0.9

With 2 servers: 1/(0.1 + 0.9/2) = 1.82x
With 4 servers: 1/(0.1 + 0.9/4) = 3.08x
With ∞ servers: 1/0.1 = 10x maximum

Reality: Database becomes bottleneck at 10x scale
```

```latex
C(N) = \frac{N}{1 + \alpha(N-1) + \beta N(N-1)}
```

**Plain English:** Extends Amdahl's Law to include coordination overhead that grows quadratically.

**Variables:**
- `N`: Number of processors/nodes
- `α`: Contention coefficient
- `β`: Coherency/coordination coefficient
- `C(N)`: Capacity at N nodes

**Real-World Example:**
```
Distributed database cluster:
- α = 0.05 (lock contention)
- β = 0.01 (consensus overhead)

Performance vs nodes:
- 1 node: 1.0x baseline
- 2 nodes: 1.82x (good)
- 4 nodes: 2.75x (diminishing returns)
- 8 nodes: 3.23x (coordination cost visible)
- 16 nodes: 2.89x (negative returns!)

Optimal size: ~12 nodes for this workload
```

**When to Use:**

- `S`: Sequential fraction

**Real-World Example:**
```
Big data processing:
- Process 1TB with 1 server: 10 hours
- Process 10TB with 10 servers: still 10 hours
- Sequential overhead: 5% (S = 0.05)
- Speedup: 10 - 0.05(10-1) = 9.55x
- Efficiency: 95.5%

vs Amdahl's fixed 1TB workload:
- Speedup: 1/(0.05 + 0.95/10) = 6.9x
- Efficiency: 69%
```

**When to Use:**
- Big data scaling justification
- Variable workload sizing
- MapReduce-style systems

```

**Plain English:** True system cost includes initial investment, ongoing operations, and risk mitigation.

**Variables:**
- `CapEx`: Capital expenditure (upfront costs)
- `OpEx`: Operational expenditure (per time period)
- `Risk_cost`: Expected cost of failures

**Real-World Example:**
```
Multi-cloud strategy:
Single cloud:
- CapEx: $100K (setup)
- OpEx: $50K/month
- Risk: $10M outage × 0.1% chance = $10K/year expected
- 3-year TCO: $100K + $1.8M + $30K = $1.93M

Multi-cloud:
- CapEx: $300K (complex setup)
- OpEx: $60K/month (overhead)
- Risk: $10M × 0.01% = $1K/year expected

- 10 engineers: 45 relationships
- Conway's Law: System mirrors communication structure
```

**When to Use:**

- Investment: $200K (3 engineers × 2 months)
- Current latency cost: $100K/month (lost revenue)
- Improvement: 50% latency reduction
- Savings: $50K/month
- Payback period: 4 months
- 1-year ROI: ($600K - $200K)/$200K = 200%
```

## Chaos & Complexity Theory

### Phase Transition Model

**Formula:**
```latex
P(cascade) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
```

**Plain English:** Probability of cascade failure grows exponentially with load and time.

**Variables:**
- `λ`: Cascade rate parameter
- `t`: Time or load factor
- `P(cascade)`: Probability of cascade failure

**Real-World Example:**

- 2x load (λ = 0.2): P(cascade) in 1 hour = 18%
- 3x load (λ = 0.3): P(cascade) in 1 hour = 26%
- Critical point: λ ≥ 1.0 means certain cascade

Knight Capital (2012):
- Trading algorithm went rogue
- λ jumped to ~5.0 instantaneously  
- Cascade probability: ~99.99%
- Result: $440M loss in 45 minutes
```

- 3 services: 3² = 9 potential interactions
- 10 services: 10² = 100 interactions (11x)
- 30 services: 30² = 900 interactions (100x)

Debugging time correlation:
- Small system (5 services): 2 hours average

## Consensus & Distributed Algorithms

### CAP Theorem Formalization

**Formula:**
```latex
\forall system\ S: (C \land A \land P) = \emptyset
```

**Plain English:** No system can simultaneously guarantee Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

**When Partition Occurs:**
```latex
During\ partition\ P: C \lor A, \neg(C \land A)
```

**Real-World Example:**
```
MongoDB default configuration:
- During network partition
- Choice: Consistency (primary unavailable) OR
- Availability (stale reads from secondary)
- Default: Chooses consistency
- Application impact: Writes fail, reads may be stale

Cassandra default:
- During partition: Chooses availability
- Writes succeed to any replica
- Reads may return stale data
- Eventual consistency model
```

**When to Use:**
- System design trade-off decisions
- Understanding partition behavior
- Setting consistency requirements

### Consensus Lower Bounds

**Formulas:**
```latex
Rounds_{synchronous} \geq f + 1

Rounds_{asynchronous} = \infty\ (FLP\ impossibility)
```

**Plain English:**
- Synchronous networks need at least f+1 rounds to handle f failures
- Asynchronous networks cannot guarantee consensus (FLP theorem)

**Real-World Example:**
```
Raft consensus:
- 5-node cluster (tolerates 2 failures)
- Minimum rounds for leader election: 3
- Typical election time: 150-300ms
- Partition healing: 1-2 rounds additional

Bitcoin (asynchronous):
- Uses proof-of-work to bypass FLP
- ~10 minute block times
- Probabilistic finality
- 6 confirmations ≈ 99.9% certainty
```

**When to Use:**
- Consensus algorithm selection
- Understanding latency vs consistency
- Setting timeout values
