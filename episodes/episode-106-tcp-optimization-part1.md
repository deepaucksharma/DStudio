### Part 1: Mathematical Foundations (45 minutes)

#### 1.1 TCP Congestion Control Theory (15 min)

TCP congestion control represents one of the most successful applications of control theory in distributed systems. When Netflix delivers 15 billion hours of video monthly, or when Google processes 8.5 billion searches daily, the fundamental challenge is not just moving bits across networks, but doing so efficiently while avoiding congestion collapse that plagued early Internet implementations.

The mathematical foundation of TCP congestion control rests on **Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)** algorithms, which provide both stability and fairness properties that can be rigorously proven using control theory and game theory.

**Core Mathematical Principle - AIMD Dynamics:**

Let w_i(t) be the congestion window size of flow i at time t. The AIMD algorithm follows:

```
w_i(t+1) = {
  w_i(t) + α        if no packet loss detected
  β × w_i(t)        if packet loss detected
}
```

Where:
- α > 0 is the additive increase parameter (typically 1)
- 0 < β < 1 is the multiplicative decrease parameter (typically 0.5)

**Stability Analysis:**

The key insight is that AIMD converges to a fair allocation of bandwidth among competing flows. For n flows sharing a bottleneck link with capacity C, the equilibrium condition is:

Σ(i=1 to n) w_i = C × RTT

At equilibrium, each flow gets approximately C/n capacity, achieving **max-min fairness**.

**Mathematical Proof of Convergence:**

Consider two flows with window sizes w₁ and w₂. Define:
- x = w₁ + w₂ (total load)
- y = |w₁ - w₂| (unfairness)

The AIMD dynamics become:
- If no loss: x increases by 2α, y unchanged
- If loss: x decreases by factor β, y decreases by factor β

The system converges to the efficiency line (x = C) and fairness line (y = 0) because:
1. Movement towards efficiency line when underutilized
2. Movement towards fairness line when overutilized
3. Both movements are strictly decreasing in their respective metrics

**Fundamental Throughput Equation:**

The famous TCP throughput equation, derived by Mathis et al., provides the theoretical maximum throughput:

**Throughput ≈ (MSS/RTT) × (1/√p)**

Where:
- MSS = Maximum Segment Size
- RTT = Round Trip Time  
- p = packet loss probability

This square-root relationship has profound implications:
- To double throughput, packet loss must be reduced by 4×
- High-RTT flows get exponentially lower throughput
- Loss probability dominates throughput more than RTT

**Derivation of the Square-Root Law:**

Starting from the AIMD sawtooth pattern:

1. **Steady State Window Size**: W_max ≈ 1/√p
2. **Average Window**: W_avg ≈ (3/4)W_max = (3/4)/√p
3. **Throughput**: T = W_avg/RTT = (3/4) × MSS/(RTT√p)

The constant 3/4 comes from the geometric mean of the sawtooth pattern between W_max and W_max/2.

**Loss Event Probability and Window Dynamics:**

The relationship between loss probability p and window size follows from the AIMD algorithm. If the window size when loss occurs is W, then:

p = 2/(W² + W) ≈ 2/W² for large W

This gives us W ≈ √(2/p), which when substituted into the throughput equation yields the square-root relationship.

**TCP Reno Mathematical Model:**

TCP Reno uses duplicate ACKs for loss detection. The mathematical model includes:

1. **Slow Start Phase**: W(t) = 2^t until W reaches ssthresh
2. **Congestion Avoidance**: W(t+RTT) = W(t) + MSS²/W(t)
3. **Fast Recovery**: W = W/2, then linear increase

The transition between phases creates a complex dynamical system that can be modeled using **piecewise-linear differential equations**:

```
dW/dt = {
  W/RTT                    (slow start)
  MSS/RTT                  (congestion avoidance)
  -W/2 + MSS/RTT          (fast recovery)
}
```

#### 1.2 Advanced Congestion Control Algorithms (20 min)

**TCP Cubic Mathematical Framework:**

TCP Cubic, designed for high-bandwidth networks, replaces AIMD with a cubic function for window growth. The mathematical foundation addresses AIMD's poor performance in high bandwidth-delay product (BDP) networks.

**Cubic Window Growth Function:**

W(t) = C(t - K)³ + W_max

Where:
- C = scaling factor (typically 0.4)
- K = time to reach W_max in absence of loss
- W_max = window size at time of last loss event
- t = elapsed time since last loss

**Derivation of Cubic Parameters:**

The cubic function is designed to:
1. **Be concave initially** (faster than linear growth)
2. **Have inflection point at W_max** 
3. **Be convex after W_max** (aggressive probing)

The parameter K is calculated as:
K = ∛((W_max × β)/C)

Where β is the multiplicative decrease factor (0.2 for Cubic vs 0.5 for Reno).

**TCP-Friendly Region:**

Cubic includes a "TCP-friendly" mode to ensure fairness with Reno flows:

W_tcp(t) = W_max × β + (3(1-β)/(1+β)) × (t/RTT)

The actual window is: W(t) = max(W_cubic(t), W_tcp(t))

**Mathematical Analysis of Cubic Behavior:**

1. **RTT Independence**: Unlike Reno, Cubic's growth is independent of RTT in steady state
2. **Scalability**: Growth rate increases with network capacity
3. **Convergence Time**: O(∛BDP) vs O(BDP) for Reno

**BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) Algorithm:**

Google's BBR represents a paradigm shift from loss-based to model-based congestion control. The mathematical foundation relies on **optimal control theory** and **network path modeling**.

**Core BBR Model:**

BBR models the network path with two key parameters:
- BtlBw = Bottleneck Bandwidth
- RTprop = Round-trip propagation delay

**Optimal Operating Point:**

The optimal sending rate that maximizes throughput while minimizing delay is:

**Rate = BtlBw**
**Inflight = BtlBw × RTprop (BDP)**

**BBR State Machine Mathematics:**

BBR operates in four states with different mathematical objectives:

1. **STARTUP**: Exponential search for BtlBw
   - Pacing_gain = 2/ln(2) ≈ 2.89 (optimal bandwidth probing)
   - cwnd_gain = 2/ln(2)

2. **DRAIN**: Reduce queue buildup
   - Pacing_gain = 1/2.89 ≈ 0.35
   - Target: Drain excess packets from STARTUP

3. **PROBE_BW**: Steady-state bandwidth probing
   - Pacing_gain cycles: [1.25, 0.75, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (8-phase cycle)
   - Mathematical balance: Σ gains = 8 (neutral long-term effect)

4. **PROBE_RTT**: Minimize RTT measurement
   - cwnd = 4 (minimum viable window)
   - Duration: 200ms minimum

**Mathematical Derivation of BBR Gains:**

The STARTUP gain 2/ln(2) comes from optimal binary search theory:
- To find capacity C in minimum time with exponential probing
- Each RTT doubles the probing rate
- Optimal gain maximizes information gained per RTT

For PROBE_BW, the cycling gains solve the **exploration-exploitation tradeoff**:
- Higher gains (1.25) probe for increased bandwidth
- Lower gains (0.75) allow queue drain
- Neutral gains (1.0) provide stable operation

**Loss Detection Mathematical Models:**

**Fast Retransmit Algorithm:**

The probability of false fast retransmit (reordering mistaken for loss) follows:

P(false_positive) = P(reorder_distance > 3)

Assuming reordering distance follows an exponential distribution with rate λ:

P(false_positive) = e^(-3λ)

**SACK (Selective Acknowledgment) Mathematics:**

SACK provides fine-grained loss information. The efficiency gain can be modeled as:

Efficiency_SACK = 1 - P(unnecessary_retransmission)

For random loss pattern with loss rate p:
P(unnecessary_retransmission) ≈ p² (second-order losses)

Therefore: Efficiency_SACK ≈ 1 - p²

**Duplicate ACK Threshold Analysis:**

The optimal threshold k for fast retransmit minimizes:

Cost = P(false_positive) × C_fp + P(false_negative) × C_fn

Where:
- C_fp = cost of unnecessary fast retransmit
- C_fn = cost of waiting for timeout

The optimal threshold satisfies:
dCost/dk = 0

This typically yields k = 3 for most network conditions.

#### 1.3 Bandwidth-Delay Product and Window Sizing (10 min)

**Mathematical Definition of BDP:**

BDP = Bandwidth × Round-Trip Delay

This represents the **maximum amount of data in flight** that fully utilizes the network pipe without creating excess queuing delay.

**Optimal Window Sizing Theory:**

For maximum throughput without excessive delay:

Optimal_Window = BDP = Bandwidth × RTT

**Derivation from Little's Law:**

Applying Little's Law to the network pipe:
- L = average packets in network
- λ = packet sending rate  
- W = average delay (RTT)

Therefore: L = λ × RTT

For maximum efficiency: λ = Bandwidth/PacketSize

So: Optimal_Window = (Bandwidth/PacketSize) × RTT × PacketSize = Bandwidth × RTT

**Buffer Sizing Mathematics:**

The **rule of thumb** for router buffer sizing has evolved:

**Classic Rule**: Buffer = RTT × C (bandwidth)
**Modern Rule**: Buffer = RTT × C / √N

Where N = number of flows.

**Mathematical Justification:**

With N synchronized flows, the aggregate window oscillation has standard deviation:
σ_aggregate = σ_single × √N

By central limit theorem, buffer requirements scale as √N rather than N.

**Window Scaling and Mathematical Limits:**

TCP's 16-bit window field limits throughput in high-BDP networks:

Max_Throughput = (65535 bytes / RTT)

For transcontinental links (RTT ≈ 150ms):
Max_Throughput ≈ 437 KB/s ≈ 3.5 Mbps

**Window Scaling Factor:**

With window scaling, effective window = advertised_window × 2^scale_factor

The scale factor s satisfies:
2^s × 65535 ≥ BDP

Therefore: s ≥ log₂(BDP/65535)

**Bandwidth Estimation Algorithms:**

**Packet Pair Technique:**

Send two back-to-back packets, measure arrival time difference Δt.
Bottleneck bandwidth estimate: B̂ = PacketSize/Δt

**Error Analysis:**
- Systematic error from cross-traffic
- Random error from network jitter
- Confidence interval: B̂ ± z_(α/2) × σ_B/√n

**Pathload Algorithm:**

Send packet streams at rate R, measure one-way delays.
If delays increase: R > available_bandwidth
If delays stable: R ≤ available_bandwidth

Mathematical foundation: **M/M/1 queueing model**
- Service rate = available bandwidth
- Arrival rate = probing stream rate
- Queue stable if λ < μ

### Part 2: Implementation Details (60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Congestion Window Dynamics Modeling (20 min)

**Stochastic Models for TCP Performance:**

Real networks exhibit random behavior that requires **stochastic process modeling**:

**Markov Model for Loss Process:**

State transitions:
- Good state: p₀₁ = probability of transitioning to Bad
- Bad state: p₁₀ = probability of transitioning to Good

Stationary probabilities:
- π₀ = p₁₀/(p₀₁ + p₁₀) (Good state)
- π₁ = p₀₁/(p₀₁ + p₁₀) (Bad state)

**Gilbert-Elliott Model:**

Two-state Markov chain for packet loss:
- State 0: Low loss probability p₀
- State 1: High loss probability p₁

Average loss rate: p_avg = π₀p₀ + π₁p₁

**TCP Throughput in Correlated Loss Environment:**

For Gilbert-Elliott loss model, TCP throughput becomes:

Throughput ≈ (MSS/RTT) × f(p_avg, correlation_parameters)

Where f() is a complex function depending on loss correlation structure.

**Renewal Theory Application:**

TCP congestion avoidance can be modeled as a **renewal process**:
- Renewal events = loss events
- Inter-renewal periods = congestion avoidance epochs

The renewal reward theorem gives:
Average_Throughput = E[packets_sent_per_epoch]/E[epoch_duration]

**Mathematical Analysis of Sawtooth Pattern:**

During congestion avoidance between losses:
- Window grows linearly: W(t) = W₀ + t
- Average window over epoch: W_avg = (W_min + W_max)/2
- Epoch duration: T = (W_max - W_min) RTTs

**Compound TCP Mathematical Model:**

Compound TCP modifies standard TCP with:
W(t+1) = W(t) + α/W(t) + γ

Where γ is the delay-based component:
γ = {
  1     if RTT < RTT_baseline + β
  -1    if RTT > RTT_baseline + β  
  0     otherwise
}

**Mathematical Stability Analysis:**

The system is stable if the Lyapunov function V = ½(W - W*)² decreases:
ΔV = (W - W*)(α/W + γ) < 0

This requires careful tuning of α and β parameters.

**Fluid Model Analysis:**

TCP can be approximated by differential equations in **fluid limit**:

dW/dt = 1/RTT - W × p(W)/RTT

Where p(W) is the loss probability as a function of window size.

**Equilibrium Analysis:**

At equilibrium: dW/dt = 0
Therefore: 1/RTT = W* × p(W*)/RTT
Which gives: W* = 1/p(W*)

This is the **fixed point equation** for TCP window size.

**Multiple Flow Analysis:**

For n flows sharing a bottleneck, the vector differential equation:
dW⃗/dt = 1⃗/RTT⃗ - W⃗ ⊙ p⃗(W⃗)./RTT⃗

Where ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication.

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**

Each flow maximizes its utility function:
U_i(x_i) = w_i log(x_i) - x_i p_i(x⃗)

The Nash equilibrium satisfies:
∂U_i/∂x_i = w_i/x_i - p_i(x⃗) = 0

This gives the **proportional fairness** allocation.

#### 2.2 RTT and Throughput Mathematical Relationships (25 min)

**RTT Measurement and Filtering:**

TCP uses **exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)** for RTT estimation:

RTT_smooth(n) = α × RTT_smooth(n-1) + (1-α) × RTT_sample(n)

Where α = 7/8 (chosen for stability vs responsiveness trade-off).

**Mathematical Analysis of EWMA:**

The transfer function of EWMA filter:
H(z) = (1-α)/(1 - αz⁻¹)

Frequency response:
|H(ejω)| = (1-α)/√(1 + α² - 2α cos(ω))

**Optimal α Selection:**

Minimize mean square error between estimate and true RTT:
α_optimal = σ²_RTT/(σ²_RTT + σ²_noise)

Where σ²_RTT is RTT variance and σ²_noise is measurement noise variance.

**RTO (Retransmission Timeout) Calculation:**

Jacobson-Karels Algorithm:
- RTT_var(n) = β × RTT_var(n-1) + (1-β) × |RTT_sample(n) - RTT_smooth(n)|
- RTO(n) = RTT_smooth(n) + 4 × RTT_var(n)

The factor 4 comes from **Chebyshev's inequality**:
P(|X - μ| > kσ) ≤ 1/k²

For k = 4: P(timeout_unnecessary) ≤ 6.25%

**Karn's Algorithm Mathematics:**

Problem: Retransmitted segments create **ambiguous RTT samples**

Solution: Ignore RTT samples for retransmitted segments
Mathematical justification: Retransmission biases RTT distribution

**Throughput-RTT Relationship Analysis:**

**Basic Relationship:**
Throughput = Window_Size/RTT

**With Packet Loss:**
Throughput ≈ (MSS/RTT) × (1/√p)

**With Multiple Bottlenecks:**
For k bottlenecks in series with capacities C₁, C₂, ..., Cₖ:
Throughput ≤ min(C₁, C₂, ..., Cₖ)

**With Queueing Delay:**
Total_RTT = Propagation_Delay + Queueing_Delay

For M/M/1 queue: Queueing_Delay = ρ/(μ(1-ρ))

Where ρ = utilization, μ = service rate.

**Mathematical Model of RTT Inflation:**

As network utilization increases:
RTT(ρ) = RTT_min + RTT_queue(ρ)
RTT_queue(ρ) = (packet_size × ρ)/(bandwidth × (1-ρ))

This shows RTT → ∞ as ρ → 1.

**Cross-Traffic Impact on RTT:**

With Poisson cross-traffic arrival rate λ_c:
RTT_effective = RTT_baseline × (1 + λ_c × T_service)

Where T_service is average service time per cross-traffic packet.

**Geographic RTT Analysis:**

For fiber-optic links:
RTT_min = 2 × distance/(speed_of_light/refractive_index)

Refractive index ≈ 1.5, so:
Speed in fiber ≈ 2×10⁸ m/s

**Continental Examples:**
- New York to London: ~10,000 km → RTT_min ≈ 100ms
- San Francisco to Tokyo: ~8,000 km → RTT_min ≈ 80ms

**Satellite Link Analysis:**

Geostationary orbit: 35,786 km altitude
RTT_satellite = 4 × 35,786/300,000 ≈ 480ms

Low Earth Orbit (LEO): 500-1,200 km altitude
RTT_LEO ≈ 4 × 800/300,000 ≈ 11ms

**Buffer Bloat Mathematics:**

Excessive buffering creates artificial RTT inflation:
RTT_bufferbloat = RTT_baseline + Buffer_Size/Transmission_Rate

For typical DSL: Buffer_Size = 1MB, Rate = 1Mbps
RTT_inflation = 8 seconds!

**Mathematical Solution - AQM (Active Queue Management):**

**RED (Random Early Detection):**
Drop probability increases linearly with queue size:

P_drop = {
  0                           if q < min_th
  (q - min_th)/(max_th - min_th) × max_p   if min_th ≤ q < max_th  
  1                           if q ≥ max_th
}

**CoDel (Controlled Delay):**
Target: Keep queueing delay below 5ms
Drop packets if sojourn time > target for interval > 100ms

Mathematical control law:
next_drop_time = current_time + interval/√(drop_count)

#### 2.3 Loss Detection Algorithm Analysis (15 min)

**Fast Retransmit Statistical Analysis:**

**False Positive Rate:**
P(false_positive) = P(reorder > threshold)

For exponentially distributed reorder distance with rate λ:
P(false_positive) = e^(-λ × threshold)

**Optimal Threshold Selection:**

Minimize total cost:
Cost = P_fp × C_fp + (1 - P_detection) × C_timeout

Where:
- P_fp = false positive rate
- C_fp = cost of unnecessary retransmission  
- C_timeout = cost of waiting for RTO

**Derivative-based Optimization:**
dCost/d(threshold) = 0 yields optimal threshold.

**SACK Mathematical Model:**

SACK blocks specify received ranges: [left_edge, right_edge)

**Hole Detection Algorithm:**
For each SACK block, find gaps in sequence space:
Holes = {(last_ack, left₁), (right₁, left₂), ..., (rightₖ, highest_sent)}

**SACK Efficiency Analysis:**

Without SACK: Retransmit entire window on loss
With SACK: Retransmit only lost segments

Efficiency gain = 1 - (segments_retransmitted_SACK/segments_retransmitted_RENO)

For random loss rate p:
Efficiency_gain ≈ 1 - p (first-order approximation)

**NewReno Mathematical Model:**

Partial ACK detection:
if (ACK_num > last_ACK) and (ACK_num < highest_sent):
    # Partial ACK - continue fast recovery
    retransmit(ACK_num + 1)

**Mathematical Analysis of Recovery Time:**

With k losses in window W:
- Reno: k × RTO (timeout for each loss)
- NewReno: k × RTT (fast recovery for each loss)  
- SACK: 1 × RTT (parallel recovery)

**Loss Rate Estimation:**

**Exponential Averaging:**
p_est(n) = α × p_est(n-1) + (1-α) × loss_indicator(n)

Where loss_indicator(n) = 1 if packet n is lost, 0 otherwise.

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**
For Bernoulli loss process:
p_MLE = (number_of_losses)/(total_packets_sent)

**Confidence Interval:**
p ± z_(α/2) × √(p(1-p)/n)

**TCP Loss Inference Algorithms:**

**Biaz Algorithm:**
Distinguishes congestion loss from corruption loss:
- Congestion: Multiple losses in window
- Corruption: Single random loss

Mathematical test:
if (losses_in_window > threshold):
    classify_as_congestion()
else:
    classify_as_corruption()

**Spike Algorithm:**
Uses RTT measurements to infer congestion:
if (RTT > baseline_RTT × threshold):
    infer_congestion()

### Part 3: Performance Models and Analysis (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 Analytical Performance Models (15 min)

**Padhye Model for TCP Throughput:**

Most comprehensive analytical model for TCP performance:

X = min(W_max/RTT, 1/(RTT√(2p/3) + T_0 min(1, 3√(3p/8)) × p(1 + 32p²)))

Where:
- W_max = maximum window size
- RTT = round-trip time  
- p = packet loss rate
- T_0 = retransmission timeout

**Derivation Components:**

1. **Additive Increase Phase:**
   - Duration: W_max/(2RTT) 
   - Packets sent: W_max²/(4RTT)

2. **Timeout Events:**
   - Probability of timeout: min(1, 3√(3p/8))
   - Timeout penalty: T_0 × p

3. **Fast Recovery:**
   - Accounts for triple duplicate ACK recovery
   - Reduces timeout impact

**Mathematical Validation:**

Model accuracy within 10% for:
- Loss rates: 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻¹
- RTT range: 10ms to 1s
- Buffer sizes: 1 to 100 packets

**Steady-State Window Distribution:**

For TCP Reno, window size follows **truncated geometric distribution**:

P(W = k) = (1-p)^(k-1) × p for k = 1, 2, ..., W_max

Mean window size:
E[W] = (1-(1-p)^W_max)/(p(1-(1-p)^W_max)) ≈ 1/p for small p

**Transient Analysis:**

**Slow Start Phase:**
W(t) = 2^(t/RTT) until loss or ssthresh

**Expected Slow Start Duration:**
For loss probability p per packet:
E[duration] = RTT × log₂(1/p)

**Congestion Avoidance Phase:**
W(t) = W_0 + t/RTT

Time to next loss event:
T_loss ~ Geometric(p) with mean 1/p RTTs

**Renewal Theory Application:**

TCP exhibits **renewal behavior** at loss events:

**Renewal Epochs:**
- Start: Window = W_max/2 (after loss)
- End: Window = W_max (next loss)

**Inter-renewal Duration:**
T = (W_max - W_max/2) × RTT = W_max × RTT/2

**Packets per Epoch:**
N = Σ(i=W_max/2 to W_max) i = (W_max)²/4

**Throughput via Renewal Reward:**
X = E[N]/E[T] = ((W_max)²/4)/(W_max × RTT/2) = W_max/(2RTT)

#### 3.2 Network Path Modeling (15 min)

**Multi-Bottleneck Analysis:**

For n bottlenecks in series with capacities C₁ ≤ C₂ ≤ ... ≤ Cₙ:

**Effective Capacity:**
C_eff = C₁ (first bottleneck dominates)

**Effective RTT:**
RTT_eff = Σ(propagation_delays) + Σ(queueing_delays)

**Buffer Requirements:**
Each bottleneck needs buffer ≥ C_i × RTT_i

**Mathematical Model of Network Path:**

**Transfer Function Approach:**
Network path as linear time-invariant system:
Y(s) = H(s) × X(s)

Where:
- X(s) = input traffic (Laplace domain)
- Y(s) = output traffic
- H(s) = network transfer function

**For simple delay line:**
H(s) = e^(-sT) where T = propagation delay

**For lossy channel:**
H(s) = (1-p) × e^(-sT) where p = loss probability

**Queueing Network Model:**

**Jackson Network:**
Network of M/M/1 queues with routing probabilities r_ij

**Steady-State Analysis:**
Traffic equations: λ_i = γ_i + Σ_j λ_j r_ji

Where:
- λ_i = arrival rate to queue i
- γ_i = external arrival rate to queue i
- r_ji = probability of routing from j to i

**Product Form Solution:**
π(n₁, n₂, ..., nₖ) = Π_i (ρᵢⁿⁱ(1-ρᵢ))

Where ρᵢ = λᵢ/μᵢ < 1 for stability.

**Path Capacity Estimation:**

**Probe Gap Model (PGM):**
Send packet pairs with gap g, measure output gap g':

If g' = g: Cross-traffic < (C-R)
If g' > g: Cross-traffic > (C-R)

Where C = link capacity, R = probe rate.

**Mathematical Analysis:**
For Poisson cross-traffic with rate λ:
E[g'] = g + λ × packet_size/C

**Variable Packet Size (VPS) Method:**
Send packets of different sizes, measure dispersion:
Capacity = packet_size_difference/dispersion_difference

**Statistical Accuracy:**
Standard error: σ/√n where n = number of measurements
Confidence interval: estimate ± t_(α/2) × SE

**Network Tomography:**

**End-to-End Loss Inference:**
From end-to-end loss rates, infer individual link loss rates.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
For tree topology with k leaves:
p_path_i = 1 - Π_links_on_path_i (1 - p_link_j)

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**
Maximize: L = Π_i p_path_i^X_i × (1-p_path_i)^(n_i-X_i)

Where X_i = losses on path i, n_i = packets sent on path i.

**Solution via EM Algorithm:**
Iteratively update link loss estimates until convergence.

### Part 4: Optimization Strategies (15 minutes)

#### 4.1 Mathematical Optimization Framework (8 min)

**Network Utility Maximization (NUM):**

**Optimization Problem:**
maximize: Σ_i U_i(x_i)
subject to: Ax ≤ c

Where:
- U_i(x_i) = utility function of flow i
- x_i = rate allocated to flow i
- A = routing matrix
- c = link capacity vector

**Lagrangian:**
L = Σ_i U_i(x_i) - Σ_l λ_l(Σ_i A_li x_i - c_l)

**KKT Conditions:**
∂L/∂x_i = U'_i(x_i) - Σ_l λ_l A_li = 0
λ_l(Σ_i A_li x_i - c_l) = 0
λ_l ≥ 0, x_i ≥ 0

**TCP as Distributed Solution:**

TCP's AIMD algorithm solves NUM with:
- Utility: U_i(x_i) = w_i log(x_i)
- Price: p_l = λ_l (congestion signal)

**Proportional Fairness:**
At optimum: x_i = w_i/Σ_l A_li λ_l

**Convergence Analysis:**

**Gradient Ascent Dynamics:**
dx_i/dt = κ_i[U'_i(x_i) - p_i(t)]
dp_l/dt = ε_l[Σ_i A_li x_i - c_l]

Where κ_i, ε_l > 0 are step sizes.

**Stability Condition:**
System stable if Jacobian has negative real eigenvalues.
Requires: κ_i × ε_l < threshold (depends on network topology)

#### 4.2 Advanced Control Algorithms (7 min)

**Model Predictive Control (MPC) for TCP:**

**State Model:**
x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) + w(k)

Where:
- x(k) = [cwnd(k), RTT(k)]ᵀ
- u(k) = congestion control action
- w(k) = disturbance (cross-traffic, etc.)

**Cost Function:**
J = Σ_(k=0)^N [||x(k) - x_ref||²_Q + ||u(k)||²_R]

**Optimization:**
min_u J subject to constraints on cwnd, throughput

**Reinforcement Learning Approach:**

**State Space:** S = {cwnd, RTT, loss_rate, bandwidth_estimate}
**Action Space:** A = {increase_cwnd, decrease_cwnd, maintain}
**Reward Function:** R = throughput - α × delay - β × loss

**Q-Learning Update:**
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

**Policy:** π(s) = argmax_a Q(s,a)

**Deep Reinforcement Learning:**

**Neural Network Function Approximation:**
Q(s,a; θ) ≈ Q*(s,a)

**Loss Function:**
L(θ) = E[(r + γ max_a' Q(s',a'; θ⁻) - Q(s,a; θ))²]

Where θ⁻ are target network parameters.

## Mathematical Insights and Key Takeaways

### Fundamental Relationships

1. **Square-Root Law**: TCP throughput ~ 1/√(loss_rate)
   - Profound implication: Small loss rate improvements yield large throughput gains
   - Mathematical proof via renewal theory and AIMD analysis

2. **BDP Principle**: Optimal window = Bandwidth × RTT
   - Foundation for all modern congestion control
   - Derived from Little's Law and queueing theory

3. **AIMD Convergence**: Guarantees fairness and stability
   - Mathematical proof using Lyapunov functions
   - Convergence rate depends on network topology

### Advanced Models

1. **Fluid Models**: Differential equation approximations for large-scale analysis
2. **Stochastic Models**: Account for network randomness and correlation
3. **Game Theory**: Multi-flow interactions as non-cooperative games

### Optimization Principles

1. **Utility Maximization**: TCP as distributed solution to global optimization
2. **Control Theory**: Modern algorithms use feedback control principles
3. **Machine Learning**: AI-driven congestion control for complex scenarios

The mathematical foundations of TCP optimization reveal the elegant interplay between probability theory, control systems, optimization, and game theory. These models not only explain existing algorithms but provide the theoretical foundation for designing next-generation transport protocols for emerging networks like 5G, satellite constellations, and data center fabrics.

Understanding these mathematical relationships enables network engineers to make principled decisions about protocol design, parameter tuning, and performance optimization rather than relying on trial-and-error approaches. The convergence of classical applied mathematics with modern machine learning techniques promises even more sophisticated transport protocols optimized for specific application requirements and network conditions.
