# Pattern Documentation Structure Guide

This guide ensures all patterns in the Compendium follow a consistent structure for optimal learning.

## Required Sections

### 1. Pattern Header
```markdown
# Pattern Name

**One-line description - The key insight**

> *"A memorable quote that captures the essence"*
```

### 2. Pattern Overview (🎯)
- **The Problem**: Clear problem statement with examples
- **The Solution**: High-level solution approach
- **When to Use**: Decision table (✅ Use When | ❌ Don't Use When)

### 3. Architecture & Implementation (🏗️)
- **Conceptual Model**: Mermaid diagram showing components
- **Key Components**: Table of components and responsibilities
- **Implementation Example**: Clean, commented code example

### 4. Analysis & Trade-offs (📊)
- **Axiom Relationships**: How pattern relates to 8 axioms
- **Trade-off Analysis**: What you gain vs what you lose
- **Common Pitfalls**: Top 3-5 mistakes and how to avoid

### 5. Practical Considerations (🔧)
- **Configuration Guidelines**: Key parameters and defaults
- **Monitoring & Metrics**: What to measure and alert on
- **Integration Patterns**: How it works with other patterns

### 6. Real-World Examples (🚀)
- At least 2 production examples
- Challenge → Implementation → Results format

### 7. Key Takeaways (🎓)
- Core insight
- When it shines
- What to watch
- Most important thing to remember

## Consistent Elements

### Visual Elements
- Use Mermaid for all diagrams (no ASCII art)
- Consistent color scheme in diagrams
- Clear visual hierarchy with headers

### Tables
All patterns should include:
1. When to Use decision table
2. Component responsibility table
3. Configuration parameter table
4. Monitoring metrics table
5. Trade-off analysis table

### Code Examples
- Python as primary language (unless pattern is language-specific)
- Clear comments explaining key concepts
- Production-ready, not toy examples
- Show both basic and advanced usage

### Cross-References
- Link to related axioms
- Link to complementary patterns
- Link to anti-patterns

## Template Usage

1. Copy PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md as starting point
2. Fill in all required sections
3. Ensure all tables are populated
4. Add at least one Mermaid diagram
5. Include 2+ real-world examples
6. Review against this guide
