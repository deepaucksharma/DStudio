# Layout Fix Summary: Content Boundaries

## Problem
Content was extending beneath the "On This Page" (Table of Contents) sidebar on the right side, making it difficult to read and breaking the layout on wider screens.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `layout.css`
- Removed aggressive full-width overrides that broke Material's layout system
- Changed content alignment from center to left
- Removed auto margins that were centering content
- Ensured all content elements respect their container boundaries

### 2. Created `content-boundaries.css`
- Enforces strict content boundaries to prevent overflow under TOC
- Implements responsive behavior:
  - Mobile (<60em): Full width with padding
  - Desktop (60-88em): Content respects TOC with proper padding
  - Ultra-wide (>88em): Max-width of 65rem for readability
- Ensures all elements (tables, code, images, grids) stay within bounds
- Adds overflow scrolling for elements that need it

### 3. CSS Load Order
The CSS files are now loaded in this order in `mkdocs.yml`:
1. `layout.css` - Base responsive layout
2. `content-boundaries.css` - Enforces content boundaries
3. `custom.css` - Custom styling
4. `navigation.css` - Navigation enhancements
5. `themes.css` - Theme customizations

## Key Changes

### Before
- Content used `margin: auto` causing center alignment
- Full-width utilities used viewport width (`100vw`)
- No explicit boundaries for content area
- Content could overflow under TOC

### After
- All content is left-aligned with `margin-left: 0`
- Full-width utilities use container width (`100%`)
- Explicit boundaries prevent overflow
- Content respects TOC presence with proper padding

## Testing
Created `layout-test.md` in `/docs/examples/` to verify:
- Text content stays within boundaries
- Code blocks scroll horizontally when needed
- Tables are contained and scrollable
- Grids respect content area
- Images scale appropriately
- All elements work across different screen sizes

## Result
Content now properly stays within its designated area and never extends under the "On This Page" sidebar, providing a clean and readable layout across all device sizes.
