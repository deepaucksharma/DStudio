# Episode 31: Raft/Paxos Consensus Algorithms

## Overview

This episode covers distributed consensus algorithms - Raft and Paxos - with practical implementations and Indian context examples.

## üáÆüá≥ Indian Context Examples

- **EVM Consensus**: Electronic Voting Machine consensus across polling stations
- **Banking Consensus**: Multi-bank transaction processing
- **Service Discovery**: etcd-like distributed coordination
- **Configuration Management**: Distributed config consensus

## üìÅ Code Structure

### Python Examples

1. **`01_basic_raft_leader_election.py`**
   - Raft leader election implementation
   - Indian Army border defense coordination scenario
   - Features: Election timeouts, vote counting, heartbeats

2. **`02_raft_log_replication.py`**
   - Raft log replication with Paytm-style transactions
   - Features: 3-phase consensus, log consistency, state machine

3. **`03_paxos_basic_proposer.py`**
   - Paxos proposer implementation with ZooKeeper-style leader election
   - Features: Two-phase protocol, prepare/accept phases

4. **`04_indian_election_consensus.py`**
   - EVM network with Byzantine fault tolerance
   - Features: Cryptographic hashing, tamper detection, audit trails

### Java Implementation

- **`RaftConsensus.java`**: Production-ready Raft implementation with thread-safe operations

### Go Implementation

- **`paxos_implementation.go`**: High-performance Paxos with goroutines and channels

## üéØ Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Raft Algorithm
- **Leader Election**: Random timeouts, majority voting
- **Log Replication**: Entry replication, commit index management
- **Safety**: Election safety, leader append-only, log matching

### Paxos Algorithm
- **Phase 1 (Prepare)**: Proposal number generation, promise collection
- **Phase 2 (Accept)**: Value acceptance, majority consensus
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles network partitions, node failures

### Indian Use Cases
- **Electronic Voting**: Secure, tamper-proof voting with audit trails
- **Banking Systems**: Multi-bank transaction consensus
- **Government Services**: Distributed identity verification

## üîß Technical Features

- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent operations with proper synchronization
- **Network Simulation**: Message passing with realistic delays
- **Failure Scenarios**: Node failures, network partitions
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration scenarios
