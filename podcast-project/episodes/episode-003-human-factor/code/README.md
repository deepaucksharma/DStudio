## üéØ Cultural Integration Examples

### Indian Festival Calendar Integration
```python
# Festival-aware scheduling
festivals = {
    "2024-03-08": "Holi",
    "2024-08-15": "Independence Day", 
    "2024-10-12": "Dussehra",
    "2024-11-01": "Diwali",
    "2024-12-25": "Christmas"
}

# Impact calculation
def get_festival_impact(date):
    major_festivals = ["Diwali", "Holi", "Eid"]
    if festival_name in major_festivals:
        return 0.8  # 80% unavailability expected
    return 0.4      # 40% unavailability expected
```

### Regional Communication Patterns
```python
# Communication style detection
communication_styles = {
    "North": {"directness": 0.8, "hierarchy_respect": 0.9},
    "South": {"directness": 0.6, "technical_depth": 0.9},
    "West": {"business_focus": 0.8, "efficiency": 0.9},
    "East": {"relationship_first": 0.9, "consensus": 0.8}
}
```

### Indian Family Structure Considerations
```python
# Family obligation patterns
family_obligations = {
    "school_pickup": {"frequency": "daily", "flexibility": 0.2},
    "elderly_care": {"frequency": "ongoing", "flexibility": 0.1},
    "festival_prep": {"frequency": "seasonal", "flexibility": 0.0},
    "arranged_marriage": {"frequency": "rare", "flexibility": 0.0}
}
```

## üí° Key Cultural Insights Implemented

### Hierarchy vs Collaboration
```python
# Psychological safety in hierarchical culture
def adjust_for_hierarchy(base_safety_score, seniority_gap):
    # Indian teams: larger seniority gaps reduce speaking up
    hierarchy_penalty = min(seniority_gap * 0.1, 0.4)
    return base_safety_score * (1 - hierarchy_penalty)
```

### Multilingual Environment
```python
# Code switching cognitive load
def calculate_language_switching_cost(hindi_time, english_time, switches):
    # Research shows 15% cognitive overhead for each language switch
    base_load = (hindi_time + english_time) * 1.0
    switching_cost = switches * 0.15
    return base_load * (1 + switching_cost)
```

### Festival and Family Priorities
```python
# Festival priority over work
def is_festival_priority(date, urgency):
    if is_major_festival(date):
        return urgency < Priority.CRITICAL  # Only critical work during festivals
    return urgency < Priority.LOW  # Normal prioritization
```

## üîß Advanced Analysis Tools

### Sentiment Analysis for Cultural Sensitivity
```python
# Analyze communication for cultural sensitivity
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_cultural_sensitivity(message):
    sentiment = TextBlob(message).sentiment
    
    # Indian cultural markers
    respectful_words = ["ji", "sir", "madam", "please"]
    direct_words = ["no", "wrong", "bad", "never"]
    
    respectful_count = sum(1 for word in respectful_words if word in message.lower())
    direct_count = sum(1 for word in direct_words if word in message.lower())
    
    cultural_score = (respectful_count - direct_count) / len(message.split())
    return cultural_score, sentiment.polarity
```

### Bias Detection Algorithms
```python
# Statistical bias detection
def detect_assignment_bias(assignments_by_gender, assignments_by_region):
    from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
    
    # Gender bias in technical vs non-technical tasks
    chi2, p_value = chi2_contingency(assignments_by_gender)
    gender_bias_detected = p_value < 0.05
    
    # Regional bias in leadership assignments  
    chi2_region, p_region = chi2_contingency(assignments_by_region)
    regional_bias_detected = p_region < 0.05
    
    return {
        "gender_bias": gender_bias_detected,
        "regional_bias": regional_bias_detected,
        "confidence": 1 - min(p_value, p_region)
    }
```

## üß™ Testing Human Factors

### Psychological Safety Testing
```python
# Test psychological safety algorithms
def test_psychological_safety():
    # Simulate different team compositions
    hierarchical_team = Team(seniority_gap=4, cultural_diversity=0.3)
    flat_team = Team(seniority_gap=1, cultural_diversity=0.8)
    
    hierarchical_safety = calculate_psychological_safety(hierarchical_team)
    flat_safety = calculate_psychological_safety(flat_team)
    
    assert hierarchical_safety < flat_safety  # Hierarchy reduces safety
    assert flat_safety > 0.7  # Flat teams should have high safety
```

### Cultural Bias Testing
```python
# Test bias detection algorithms
def test_bias_detection():
    # Create biased assignment patterns
    biased_assignments = {
        ("IIT", "Male", "North"): 15,
        ("Private", "Female", "South"): 3,
        ("Local", "Male", "West"): 7
    }
    
    bias_results = detect_cultural_bias(biased_assignments)
    assert bias_results["educational_bias"] == True
    assert bias_results["gender_bias"] == True
    assert bias_results["regional_bias"] == True
