**Code Example Referenced**: `python/probability_calculator/cascade_failure_calculator.py`

#### Monte Carlo Simulation Deep Dive (00:30-00:45)
**Simulation Parameters**:
```python
# Real IRCTC Tatkal booking scenario
services = {
    "authentication": {"availability": 0.999, "correlation_factor": 0.8},
    "booking": {"availability": 0.995, "correlation_factor": 0.9},
    "payment": {"availability": 0.998, "correlation_factor": 0.7},
    "inventory": {"availability": 0.997, "correlation_factor": 0.85},
    "notification": {"availability": 0.999, "correlation_factor": 0.6}
}

# Monte Carlo with 10,000 iterations
simulation_results = run_monte_carlo_simulation(services, iterations=10000)
```

**Results Analysis**:
- Independent probability: 99.3%
- Correlated probability: 97.1%
- Cost impact during Tatkal rush: ₹25L per minute of downtime

#### Mumbai Monsoon as System Metaphor (00:45-01:00)
**Analogy Development**:
- **Light Rain**: Minor service degradation (5-10% performance impact)
- **Heavy Downpour**: Circuit breakers triggering (20-30% capacity loss)
- **Flooding**: Complete system failure (cascade across all services)
- **Recovery**: Gradual service restoration following monsoon patterns

**System Design Principles**:
1. **Drainage Systems** = Circuit Breakers
2. **Backup Routes** = Fallback Services  
3. **Emergency Services** = Incident Response Teams
4. **Weather Forecast** = Monitoring and Alerting

**Code Example Referenced**: Custom failure patterns in `python/failure_injection/chaos_injector.py`

### HOUR 2: Building Resilient Systems (01:00 - 02:00)

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern Deep Dive (01:00-01:20)
**Three-State Model**:
```java
// Paytm Payment Gateway Configuration
CircuitBreakerConfig paytmConfig = CircuitBreakerConfig.builder()
    .failureThreshold(10)           // Open after 10 failures
    .timeoutDuration(30000)         // 30 second timeout
    .successThreshold(5)            // 5 successes to close
    .errorThresholdPercentage(50)   // 50% error rate trigger
    .build();
```

**State Transitions**:
1. **CLOSED** → Normal operation, monitoring failures
2. **OPEN** → Immediate failure return, saving resources  
3. **HALF_OPEN** → Testing with limited requests

**Business Impact Case Study**:
- Flipkart inventory service during flash sale
- Without circuit breaker: Complete system crash, ₹15Cr revenue loss
- With circuit breaker: 70% functionality maintained, ₹2Cr loss only

**Code Example Referenced**: `java/circuit_breaker/CircuitBreaker.java`

#### Chaos Engineering Philosophy (01:20-01:40)
**Netflix Principles Adapted for India**:
1. **Controlled Experiments**: Test in production safely
2. **Minimize Blast Radius**: Affect minimal users initially
3. **Learn from Failure**: Every chaos experiment teaches something
4. **Build Confidence**: Team confidence in system resilience

**Indian Implementation Challenges**:
- **Regulatory Constraints**: RBI guidelines for payment system testing
- **Cultural Resistance**: "Why break what's working?" mentality
- **Scale Complexity**: 50L+ concurrent users during peak events
- **Cost Sensitivity**: Every minute of downtime = significant revenue loss

**Safety Framework**:
```python
# Chaos experiment configuration
class ChaosExperiment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blast_radius = 0.1      # Affect only 10% of traffic
        self.duration_minutes = 5     # Short duration experiments
        self.safety_level = "SAFE"    # Production-safe settings
        self.rollback_trigger = 0.05  # Auto-rollback at 5% error rate
```

**Code Example Referenced**: `python/chaos_monkey/chaos_monkey.py`

#### SLA Mathematics and Error Budgets (01:40-02:00)
**SLA Calculation Examples**:
```python
# Indian Platform SLA Standards
slas = {
    "paytm_upi": {
        "target": 99.9,              # 99.9% availability
        "monthly_budget": 43.2,      # 43.2 minutes downtime allowed
        "cost_per_minute": 500000    # ₹5L per minute downtime cost
    },
    "flipkart_catalog": {
        "target": 99.95,             # 99.95% availability  
        "monthly_budget": 21.6,      # 21.6 minutes allowed
        "cost_per_minute": 200000    # ₹2L per minute cost
    },
    "irctc_booking": {
        "target": 99.5,              # 99.5% practical target
        "monthly_budget": 360,       # 6 hours allowed (realistic)
        "cost_per_minute": 150000    # ₹1.5L per minute cost
    }
}
```

**Error Budget Burn Rate Analysis**:
- **Healthy Burn Rate**: 5% of budget per week
- **Warning Threshold**: 25% of budget in single incident
- **Emergency Threshold**: 50% of budget burned

**Code Example Referenced**: `python/sla_calculator/sla_calculator.py`

### HOUR 3: Production Implementation (02:00 - 03:00)

#### Queue Theory for Indian Scale (02:00-02:25)
**Little's Law Application**:
```
L = λ × W
Where:
L = Average queue length
λ = Arrival rate (requests per second)  
W = Average waiting time
```

**IRCTC Tatkal Booking Analysis**:
```python
# Peak traffic scenario
arrival_rate = 50000      # 50K requests/second
service_rate = 45000      # 45K requests/second capacity
utilization = 0.89        # 89% system utilization

# Queue length prediction
average_queue_length = (utilization ** 2) / (1 - utilization)
# Result: 7.1 requests in queue on average

# Waiting time calculation  
average_wait_time = average_queue_length / arrival_rate
# Result: 0.142 seconds average wait
```

**Backpressure Strategies**:
1. **Drop Tail**: Reject new requests when queue full
2. **Load Shedding**: Drop lower priority requests first
3. **Queue Expansion**: Dynamically increase capacity
4. **Circuit Breaking**: Stop accepting requests entirely

**Code Example Referenced**: `python/queue_simulator/queue_overflow_simulator.py`

#### Correlation Detection Algorithms (02:25-02:45)
**Statistical Methods**:
```python
# Pearson correlation for linear relationships
pearson_corr = calculate_pearson_correlation(service_a_metrics, service_b_metrics)

# Spearman for non-linear relationships  
spearman_corr = calculate_spearman_correlation(service_a_metrics, service_b_metrics)

# Time-lagged correlation (15-minute delay example)
lagged_corr = calculate_lagged_correlation(
    service_a_metrics, 
    service_b_metrics, 
    lag_minutes=15
)
```

**Dangerous Correlation Thresholds**:
- **0.7-0.8**: High correlation - Monitor closely
- **0.8-0.9**: Very high correlation - Immediate action needed
- **0.9+**: Extreme correlation - Emergency architectural review

**Hidden Dependency Detection**:
- Database connection pools shared across services
- Network infrastructure single points of failure
- Deployment pipeline dependencies
- Monitoring system correlations

**Code Example Referenced**: `python/correlation_detector/correlation_analyzer.py`

#### Production Deployment Strategies (02:45-03:00)
**Phased Rollout Approach**:
1. **Phase 1**: Staging environment validation
2. **Phase 2**: Canary deployment (5% traffic)
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual rollout (25% → 50% → 100%)
4. **Phase 4**: Full production with monitoring

**Monitoring Integration**:
```python
# Metrics export configuration
monitoring_config = {
    "prometheus": True,          # Metrics collection
    "grafana": True,            # Visualization
    "alertmanager": True,       # Alerting
    "datadog": False,           # Optional APM
    "custom_dashboard": True     # Indian context dashboards
}
```

**Incident Response Framework**:
- **L0**: System completely down (< 5 min response)
- **L1**: Major functionality impacted (< 15 min response)  
- **L2**: Minor features affected (< 1 hour response)
- **L3**: Cosmetic issues (< 1 day response)

## 📝 Cheat Sheet (1 page)

### Key Formulas & Concepts

#### Probability Calculations
```python
# Independent failure probability
P(failure) = 1 - ∏(1 - P(service_i_failure))

# Correlated failure probability (with correlation factor C)
P(corr_failure) = P(independent) × (1 + C)

# Monte Carlo simulation
for i in range(10000):
    simulate_system_failure()
    collect_results()
```

#### Circuit Breaker States
```
CLOSED → OPEN: failure_count > threshold
OPEN → HALF_OPEN: timeout_duration elapsed  
HALF_OPEN → CLOSED: success_count > success_threshold
HALF_OPEN → OPEN: failure detected
```

#### SLA & Error Budget
```python
# Error budget calculation
monthly_error_budget = (1 - sla_target) × monthly_minutes
# 99.9% SLA = 43.2 minutes/month error budget

# Burn rate calculation
burn_rate = actual_downtime / error_budget
# Healthy: < 25% per week
```

#### Queue Theory (Little's Law)
```
L = λ × W
Queue Length = Arrival Rate × Average Wait Time

# Utilization factor
ρ = λ/μ (arrival_rate/service_rate)
# System unstable when ρ ≥ 1.0
```

### Common Gotchas

#### Hidden Correlations
- **Database Connection Pools**: Shared across services
- **Network Infrastructure**: Single ISP dependency  
- **Deployment Pipelines**: Shared CI/CD systems
- **Monitoring Systems**: Observer effect on observed

#### Circuit Breaker Mistakes
- **Timeout Too Short**: False positives during high load
- **Timeout Too Long**: Cascade failures before protection
- **No Fallback Strategy**: Users see blank errors
- **Ignoring Half-Open State**: System never recovers

#### Chaos Engineering Pitfalls
- **Too Aggressive Initially**: Team loses confidence
- **No Rollback Plan**: Experiment becomes real incident
- **Ignoring Business Hours**: Impact on customer experience
- **No Hypothesis**: Random breaking without learning

### Mumbai Metaphor Mappings

#### System Components → Mumbai Elements
```
Circuit Breaker = Traffic Police at Signals
Load Balancer = BEST Bus Route Distribution  
Queue Management = Mumbai Local Train Compartments
Monitoring = Traffic Control Room
Chaos Engineering = Monsoon Season Testing
SLA = Local Train Schedule Adherence
Error Budget = Acceptable Delay Minutes
```

#### Failure Patterns → Weather Patterns
```
Light Service Degradation = Light Drizzle (5-10% impact)
Circuit Breaker Triggered = Heavy Rain (20-30% capacity loss)
Cascade Failure = Flooding (Complete system breakdown)
Recovery Process = Post-Monsoon Cleanup (Gradual restoration)
```
