## Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals

### Core Philosophy and Principles

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) represents a fundamental shift from manual, error-prone infrastructure management to programmatic, version-controlled, and reproducible infrastructure deployment. The concept emerged from DevOps practices in the early 2010s, driven by companies like Netflix, Google, and Amazon who needed to manage massive scale infrastructure efficiently.

The core principles of IaC include:

**Declarative Configuration**: Instead of imperative commands, IaC focuses on describing the desired end state. This is like telling someone "I want a three-story building with these specifications" rather than "first dig the foundation, then lay the first brick..."

**Immutable Infrastructure**: Rather than modifying existing infrastructure, IaC promotes creating new infrastructure and replacing old components. This is similar to the concept of blue-green deployments but applied to infrastructure.

**Version Control**: All infrastructure changes should be tracked through version control systems like Git, enabling rollbacks, audit trails, and collaborative development.

**Reproducibility**: The same code should produce identical infrastructure across different environments - development, staging, and production.

**Self-Documenting**: Well-written IaC serves as living documentation of your infrastructure architecture.

### Historical Evolution

The journey of infrastructure management has evolved through several phases:

1. **Manual Era (1990s-2000s)**: System administrators manually configured servers, often leading to "snowflake servers" that were unique and difficult to replicate.

2. **Configuration Management Era (2000s-2010s)**: Tools like Puppet, Chef, and Ansible emerged to automate server configuration management.

3. **Cloud Era (2010s-Present)**: Cloud providers introduced APIs and services that enabled programmatic infrastructure management, leading to true IaC.

4. **Kubernetes Era (2015-Present)**: Container orchestration added another layer of infrastructure abstraction, with tools like Helm and Kustomize for Kubernetes resource management.

### Mathematical Models in IaC

IaC operations can be modeled using graph theory and state machines:

**Dependency Graphs**: Infrastructure resources form directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where nodes represent resources and edges represent dependencies. Terraform uses this concept extensively.

**State Convergence**: IaC tools implement convergence algorithms to move from current state S₀ to desired state S₁ through minimal operations:
```
Convergence Function: f(S₀) → S₁
where f minimizes cost(operations) while ensuring consistency
```

**Drift Detection**: The difference between actual infrastructure state and desired state:
```
Drift = |Actual_State - Desired_State|
```

### Core Challenges

**State Management**: Maintaining accurate state of infrastructure across distributed systems is complex. Race conditions can occur when multiple operators modify infrastructure simultaneously.

**Dependency Resolution**: Complex infrastructure dependencies require topological sorting algorithms to determine deployment order.

**Error Recovery**: When deployments fail partially, IaC tools must handle rollback scenarios gracefully.

**Security**: IaC introduces new attack vectors through code repositories, state files, and deployment pipelines.

## Terraform Ecosystem Deep Dive

### Architecture and Core Concepts

Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, represents one of the most sophisticated IaC tools available today. Its architecture is built around several key components:

**Terraform Core**: The main binary that handles configuration parsing, resource graph construction, and plan execution.

**Providers**: Plugins that interface with various APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.). Each provider is essentially a client library wrapped in Terraform's plugin protocol.

**State Management**: Terraform maintains state in files (local or remote) that track the mapping between configuration and real-world resources.

**Configuration Language (HCL)**: HashiCorp Configuration Language provides a balance between human readability and machine parsability.

### Advanced Terraform Patterns

**Module Composition**: Terraform modules enable code reuse and abstraction. Well-designed modules follow the single responsibility principle:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
  availability_zones = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
}

module "eks_cluster" {
  source = "./modules/eks"
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
}
```

**State Management Strategies**: For enterprise environments, state files become critical:

1. **Remote State**: Using S3 with DynamoDB for locking prevents concurrent modifications
2. **State Isolation**: Separate state files for different environments and components
3. **State Encryption**: Sensitive data in state files should be encrypted

**Workspace Management**: Terraform workspaces enable multiple environments from single configuration:

```bash
terraform workspace new production
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new development
```

### Terraform Enterprise Patterns

**Policy as Code**: Sentinel policies enforce governance rules:

```javascript
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

# Ensure all EC2 instances have encrypted EBS volumes
main = rule {
    all tfplan.resource_changes as _, changes {
        all changes.change.after as _, config {
            config.encrypted else true
        }
    }
}
```

**Cost Estimation**: Terraform Cloud provides cost estimation before deployment, crucial for budget management.

**Private Registry**: Organizations can host private modules and providers for internal use.

### Performance Optimization

**Parallelism**: Terraform can create resources in parallel based on dependency graph:
```bash
terraform apply -parallelism=10
```

**Resource Targeting**: For large infrastructures, targeting specific resources reduces plan/apply time:
```bash
terraform plan -target=module.database
```

**State Pruning**: Regular cleanup of unused resources from state files improves performance.

## AWS CloudFormation Advanced Patterns

### CloudFormation Architecture

CloudFormation represents AWS's native IaC solution, deeply integrated with AWS services. Understanding its architecture is crucial for AWS-centric organizations:

**Template Structure**: CloudFormation templates are JSON or YAML documents describing AWS resources:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'Production-ready VPC with public and private subnets'

Parameters:
  VpcCidr:
    Type: String
    Default: '10.0.0.0/16'
    AllowedPattern: '^(10\.([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\.([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9][0-9]|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\.0/16)$'

Resources:
  VPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: !Ref VpcCidr
      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      EnableDnsSupport: true
```

**Stack Management**: CloudFormation organizes resources into stacks, enabling atomic operations and rollback capabilities.

**Change Sets**: Preview changes before applying, similar to Terraform plans but with AWS-specific optimizations.

### Advanced CloudFormation Features

**Nested Stacks**: For complex architectures, nested stacks provide modularity:

```yaml
NetworkStack:
  Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
  Properties:
    TemplateURL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates/network.yaml
    Parameters:
      VpcCidr: !Ref VpcCidr
```

**Stack Sets**: Deploy templates across multiple AWS accounts and regions simultaneously.

**Custom Resources**: Extend CloudFormation with Lambda functions for resources not natively supported:

```yaml
CustomResource:
  Type: Custom::MyCustomResource
  Properties:
    ServiceToken: !GetAtt CustomResourceFunction.Arn
    CustomProperty: value
```

### CloudFormation vs Terraform Trade-offs

**CloudFormation Advantages**:
- Native AWS integration with immediate support for new services
- No state file management complexity
- Built-in rollback mechanisms
- IAM integration for fine-grained permissions

**CloudFormation Limitations**:
- AWS-only, no multi-cloud support
- Limited expression capabilities compared to HCL
- Slower adoption of new AWS features compared to Terraform AWS provider
- Less flexible module system

### Enterprise CloudFormation Patterns

**Account Factory Pattern**: Using CloudFormation StackSets to provision new AWS accounts with baseline security and networking:

```yaml
Parameters:
  OrganizationId:
    Type: String
    Description: AWS Organization ID for cross-account trust

Resources:
  BaselineRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: !Sub 'arn:aws:iam::${AWS::AccountId}:root'
            Condition:
              StringEquals:
                'aws:PrincipalOrgID': !Ref OrganizationId
```

**Service Catalog Integration**: CloudFormation templates can be published as Service Catalog products for self-service infrastructure:

```yaml
DatabaseProduct:
  Type: AWS::ServiceCatalog::CloudFormationProduct
  Properties:
    Name: RDS Database
    Description: Standard RDS database with backup and monitoring
    ProvisioningArtifactParameters:
      - Name: v1.0
        Description: Initial version
        Info:
          LoadTemplateFromURL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates/rds.yaml
```

## Ansible Configuration Management

### Ansible Architecture and Philosophy

Ansible, developed by Red Hat, takes a different approach to infrastructure automation. Unlike Terraform's declarative approach, Ansible uses imperative playbooks with idempotent operations:

**Agentless Architecture**: Ansible requires no agents on managed nodes, using SSH for Linux/Unix and WinRM for Windows.

**Push Model**: Ansible pushes configurations from a control node to managed nodes, unlike pull-based systems like Puppet or Chef.

**YAML-Based Playbooks**: Human-readable YAML syntax makes Ansible accessible to operations teams:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      notify: start nginx
    
    - name: Copy configuration
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify: restart nginx
  
  handlers:
    - name: start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
    
    - name: restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

### Ansible for Infrastructure Provisioning

While traditionally used for configuration management, Ansible can provision cloud infrastructure:

**Cloud Modules**: Ansible includes modules for major cloud providers:

```yaml
- name: Create VPC
  amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_net:
    name: production-vpc
    cidr_block: 10.0.0.0/16
    region: us-west-2
    tags:
      Environment: production
  register: vpc

- name: Create subnet
  amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_subnet:
    vpc_id: "{{ vpc.vpc.id }}"
    cidr: 10.0.1.0/24
    az: us-west-2a
    tags:
      Name: production-subnet
```

**Dynamic Inventory**: Ansible can discover infrastructure dynamically:

```yaml
# aws_ec2.yml inventory plugin
plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-west-2
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Environment
    prefix: env
  - key: instance_type
    prefix: type
```

### Advanced Ansible Patterns

**Role-Based Organization**: Ansible roles provide reusable components:

```
roles/
├── webserver/
│   ├── tasks/main.yml
│   ├── handlers/main.yml
│   ├── templates/nginx.conf.j2
│   └── vars/main.yml
└── database/
    ├── tasks/main.yml
    └── vars/main.yml
```

**Vault Integration**: Ansible Vault encrypts sensitive data:

```bash
ansible-vault create group_vars/production/vault.yml
```

**Tower/AWX**: Enterprise Ansible provides web UI, RBAC, and job scheduling.

### Ansible vs Traditional IaC

**Strengths**:
- Excellent for configuration management and application deployment
- Lower learning curve due to YAML syntax
- Strong orchestration capabilities
- Good Windows support

**Weaknesses**:
- State management is less sophisticated than Terraform
- Limited infrastructure-specific features
- Performance can be slower for large-scale operations
- Less suitable for immutable infrastructure patterns

## Pulumi Modern IaC

### Pulumi's Innovation in IaC

Pulumi represents the next generation of IaC tools, allowing infrastructure definition using familiar programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, C#, Java):

**Real Programming Languages**: Instead of domain-specific languages, Pulumi uses general-purpose languages:

```python
import pulumi_aws as aws

# Create VPC
vpc = aws.ec2.Vpc("production-vpc",
    cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16",
    enable_dns_hostnames=True,
    enable_dns_support=True,
    tags={"Name": "production-vpc"})

# Create internet gateway
igw = aws.ec2.InternetGateway("production-igw",
    vpc_id=vpc.id,
    tags={"Name": "production-igw"})

# Create route table
route_table = aws.ec2.RouteTable("production-rt",
    vpc_id=vpc.id,
    routes=[{
        "cidr_block": "0.0.0.0/0",
        "gateway_id": igw.id,
    }],
    tags={"Name": "production-rt"})
```

**Type Safety**: Programming languages provide compile-time type checking, catching errors before deployment.

**Rich Ecosystem**: Leverage existing libraries, testing frameworks, and tooling from programming language ecosystems.

### Pulumi Architecture

**Language SDKs**: Each supported language has an SDK that provides strongly-typed resource definitions.

**Pulumi Engine**: The core engine handles resource lifecycle management, similar to Terraform Core.

**State Management**: Like Terraform, Pulumi maintains state but offers cloud-based state storage out of the box.

**Resource Providers**: Pulumi providers bridge the gap between language SDKs and cloud APIs.

### Advanced Pulumi Patterns

**Component Resources**: Create reusable infrastructure components:

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";

export class VpcComponent extends pulumi.ComponentResource {
    public readonly vpc: aws.ec2.Vpc;
    public readonly publicSubnets: aws.ec2.Subnet[];
    public readonly privateSubnets: aws.ec2.Subnet[];

    constructor(name: string, args: VpcArgs, opts?: pulumi.ComponentResourceOptions) {
        super("custom:vpc:VpcComponent", name, {}, opts);

        this.vpc = new aws.ec2.Vpc(`${name}-vpc`, {
            cidrBlock: args.cidrBlock,
            enableDnsHostnames: true,
            enableDnsSupport: true,
        }, { parent: this });

        // Create subnets
        this.publicSubnets = [];
        this.privateSubnets = [];
        
        for (let i = 0; i < args.availabilityZones.length; i++) {
            const publicSubnet = new aws.ec2.Subnet(`${name}-public-${i}`, {
                vpcId: this.vpc.id,
                cidrBlock: args.publicSubnetCidrs[i],
                availabilityZone: args.availabilityZones[i],
                mapPublicIpOnLaunch: true,
            }, { parent: this });
            
            this.publicSubnets.push(publicSubnet);
        }
    }
}
```

**Policy as Code**: Pulumi CrossGuard enables policy enforcement:

```typescript
import { PolicyPack, validateResourceOfType } from "@pulumi/policy";
import { EC2Instance } from "@pulumi/aws/ec2";

new PolicyPack("aws-security", {
    policies: [{
        name: "encrypted-ebs-volumes",
        description: "EC2 instances must have encrypted EBS volumes",
        enforcementLevel: "mandatory",
        validateResource: validateResourceOfType(EC2Instance, (instance, args, reportViolation) => {
            if (!instance.ebsBlockDevices?.every(device => device.encrypted)) {
                reportViolation("EC2 instances must have encrypted EBS volumes");
            }
        }),
    }],
});
```

**Testing Infrastructure**: Using familiar testing frameworks:

```python
import unittest
import pulumi

class TestInfrastructure(unittest.TestCase):
    @pulumi.runtime.test
    def test_vpc_cidr(self):
        import infrastructure
        
        def check_cidr(args):
            vpc_cidr = args[0]
            self.assertEqual(vpc_cidr, "10.0.0.0/16")
        
        return pulumi.Output.all(infrastructure.vpc.cidr_block).apply(check_cidr)
```

### Pulumi vs Traditional IaC

**Advantages**:
- Familiar programming languages reduce learning curve
- Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Advanced testing capabilities
- Strong typing prevents many common errors
- Better handling of complex logic and data transformations

**Disadvantages**:
- Newer tool with smaller community
- More complex debugging compared to declarative approaches
- Potential for over-engineering with programming language features
- State management complexity similar to Terraform

## Indian Industry Case Studies

### Flipkart's Infrastructure Evolution

Flipkart, India's largest e-commerce platform, has undergone significant infrastructure transformations over its journey from a startup to a Walmart-owned giant handling billions of dollars in transactions.

**Early Days (2007-2012)**:
Flipkart started with manual server management and basic scripting. During the initial years, the team manually provisioned EC2 instances and configured them using shell scripts. This approach worked for their modest scale but became a bottleneck as they grew.

**Growth Phase (2012-2016)**:
As Flipkart expanded rapidly, they adopted Chef for configuration management. The infrastructure team wrote Chef cookbooks for different services:

```ruby
# Flipkart-style Chef cookbook for web servers
cookbook_file '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' do
  source 'nginx.conf'
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0644'
  notifies :restart, 'service[nginx]'
end

service 'nginx' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end
```

**Scale Challenges**:
During major sale events like Big Billion Days, Flipkart needed to scale infrastructure rapidly. Manual processes led to:
- 4-6 hours to provision and configure new environments
- Configuration drift between development and production
- Difficulty in maintaining consistent security policies
- High operational overhead during peak traffic events

**Modern IaC Adoption (2016-Present)**:
Flipkart transitioned to a comprehensive IaC approach using multiple tools:

1. **Terraform for Infrastructure Provisioning**: Used for creating VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances across multiple AWS regions.

2. **Ansible for Configuration Management**: Continued using Ansible for application deployment and server configuration.

3. **Kubernetes with Helm**: For containerized applications, using Helm charts as infrastructure code.

**Results**:
- Environment provisioning time reduced from 6 hours to 30 minutes
- 99.9% consistency between environments
- Automated scaling during sale events handling 10x traffic spikes
- Reduced infrastructure costs by 40% through better resource utilization

### PayTM's Automation Journey

Paytm, handling over 1.4 billion transactions monthly, required robust infrastructure automation to maintain reliability and scale.

**Challenges**:
- Supporting 500+ million users with varying transaction patterns
- Compliance with RBI regulations requiring specific security controls
- Managing infrastructure across multiple cloud providers (multi-cloud strategy)
- Ensuring zero-downtime deployments during critical payment windows

**IaC Implementation**:

Paytm developed a multi-layered IaC strategy:

**Layer 1 - Base Infrastructure (Terraform)**:
```hcl
# Paytm-style VPC configuration
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  
  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  availability_zones = ["ap-south-1a", "ap-south-1b", "ap-south-1c"]
  
  # RBI compliance requirements
  enable_vpc_flow_logs = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Application = "payment-gateway"
    Compliance = "rbi-compliant"
  }
}

# Database subnet groups for encrypted RDS
resource "aws_db_subnet_group" "payment_db" {
  name       = "payment-db-subnet-group"
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Payment DB subnet group"
    Encryption = "required"
  }
}
```

**Layer 2 - Application Infrastructure (Kubernetes + Helm)**:
```yaml
# Helm values for payment service
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: payment-service-config
data:
  database_url: "{{ .Values.database.url }}"
  encryption_key: "{{ .Values.security.encryptionKey }}"
  rbi_compliance_mode: "strict"
  
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: payment-service
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: payment-service
        image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
        env:
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: payment-db-secret
              key: password
```

**Layer 3 - Security and Compliance (Policy as Code)**:
```javascript
// Paytm OPA policy for RBI compliance
package paytm.rbi.compliance

deny[msg] {
    input.kind == "Deployment"
    not input.spec.template.spec.containers[_].securityContext.runAsNonRoot
    msg := "Containers must run as non-root for RBI compliance"
}

deny[msg] {
    input.kind == "Service"
    input.spec.type == "LoadBalancer"
    not input.metadata.annotations["service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert"]
    msg := "LoadBalancer services must use SSL certificates"
}
```

**Results and Metrics**:
- Reduced infrastructure provisioning time from 2 days to 2 hours
- Achieved 99.99% uptime during critical payment windows
- Automated compliance checks preventing 95% of policy violations
- Cost optimization through automated resource scheduling saving ₹50 crores annually

### Ola's Multi-Region Infrastructure

Ola operates in 250+ cities across India, Australia, and the UK, requiring sophisticated infrastructure management for real-time ride matching and dynamic pricing.

**Business Requirements**:
- Sub-100ms response times for ride matching APIs
- Geographic redundancy for disaster recovery
- Dynamic scaling based on real-time demand patterns
- Cost optimization across different regions and time zones

**IaC Architecture**:

**Global Infrastructure Template**:
```hcl
# Ola's global infrastructure module
module "ola_region" {
  source = "./modules/ola-region"
  
  for_each = var.regions
  
  region = each.key
  instance_types = each.value.instance_types
  min_capacity = each.value.min_capacity
  max_capacity = each.value.max_capacity
  
  # Ride matching service configuration
  ride_matching_config = {
    algorithm_version = "v2.1"
    cache_ttl = 30
    batch_size = 1000
  }
  
  # Dynamic pricing configuration
  pricing_config = {
    surge_multiplier_max = 3.0
    demand_threshold = 0.8
    supply_threshold = 0.3
  }
}

# Global load balancer for multi-region traffic distribution
resource "aws_route53_record" "api" {
  zone_id = data.aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = "api.olacabs.com"
  type    = "A"
  
  set_identifier = "primary"
  
  alias {
    name                   = module.ola_region["ap-south-1"].alb_dns_name
    zone_id                = module.ola_region["ap-south-1"].alb_zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
  
  failover_routing_policy {
    type = "PRIMARY"
  }
}
```

**Real-time Scaling Logic**:
```python
# Ola's custom autoscaling logic using Pulumi
import pulumi
import pulumi_aws as aws
import json

def create_demand_based_scaling(region_config):
    # CloudWatch metric for ride requests per minute
    ride_demand_metric = aws.cloudwatch.MetricAlarm(f"ride-demand-{region_config['region']}",

        namespace="Ola/RideMatching",
        period=60,
        statistic="Sum",
        threshold=region_config['scale_up_threshold']
    )

# Regional configurations
regions = [
    {
        "region": "ap-south-1",  # Mumbai
        "demand_threshold": 10000,
        "scale_up_threshold": 15000,

    },
    {
        "region": "ap-southeast-1",  # Singapore for international
        "demand_threshold": 5000,

        "scale_up_count": 5
    }
]

for region in regions:
    create_demand_based_scaling(region)
```

**Cost Optimization Strategy**:

## Production Battle Stories

### The Great State File Corruption of 2019 - A Major E-commerce Platform

**Background**: A major Indian e-commerce platform (similar scale to Flipkart) was using Terraform to manage their production infrastructure across multiple AWS regions. Their infrastructure included hundreds of microservices, databases, and networking components.

**The Incident**:
During a routine deployment on a Friday evening before a major sale event, multiple team members accidentally ran `terraform apply` simultaneously on the same infrastructure. This caused a race condition in the Terraform state file stored in S3.

**Timeline of Events**:

*6:30 PM* - DevOps Engineer A starts deploying updated security groups
*6:32 PM* - DevOps Engineer B simultaneously deploys database changes
*6:35 PM* - Terraform state corruption detected when resources started getting deleted unexpectedly
*6:40 PM* - Production traffic starts dropping as load balancers get misconfigured
*7:00 PM* - Emergency incident declared, revenue impact starts mounting
*11:30 PM* - State file restored from backup, infrastructure recovery begins
*2:00 AM Saturday* - Full service restoration completed

**Financial Impact**:
- 7.5 hours of partial outage during peak shopping hours
- Revenue loss: ₹45 crores (approximately $6 million USD)
- Customer trust impact: 15% drop in app ratings

**Root Causes**:
1. No state locking mechanism in place
2. Multiple team members with write access to production state
3. No proper change management process for infrastructure changes
4. State backups were not automated or frequently tested

**Lessons Learned and Solutions Implemented**:

```hcl
# Proper state locking configuration implemented post-incident
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "company-terraform-state"
    key            = "production/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
    encrypt        = true
    
    # Additional safeguards
    versioning_enabled    = true
    server_side_encryption_configuration {
      rule {
        apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
          sse_algorithm = "AES256"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# DynamoDB table for state locking
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_state_lock" {
  name           = "terraform-state-lock"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key       = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }

  point_in_time_recovery {
    enabled = true
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "TerraformStateLock"
    Environment = "production"
    Purpose     = "terraform-state-locking"
  }
}
```

**Process Improvements**:
1. Implemented GitOps workflow with pull request reviews
2. Added automated testing of Terraform configurations
3. Created separate state files for different components
4. Established on-call rotation for infrastructure changes

### The Ansible Playbook Loop from Hell - Media Streaming Platform

**Background**: A popular Indian OTT platform (similar to Hotstar) used Ansible for configuration management across thousands of servers handling video streaming and content delivery.

**The Incident**:
An Ansible playbook designed to update video transcoding servers contained a logic error that caused an infinite loop, overwhelming servers and creating a cascading failure across the entire content delivery network.

**Technical Details**:

*Problematic Playbook*:
```yaml
---
- name: Update video transcoding servers
  hosts: transcoding_servers
  serial: "20%"  # Update 20% of servers at a time
  tasks:
    - name: Stop transcoding services
      service:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: stopped
      loop:
        - ffmpeg-transcoder
        - video-processor
        - thumbnail-generator
      register: service_stop_result
      
    - name: Wait for services to stop
      wait_for:
        port: "{{ transcoding_port }}"
        state: stopped
        timeout: 300
      # BUG: This condition was incorrect
      when: service_stop_result is succeeded
      
    - name: Update transcoding software
      yum:
        name: "custom-transcoder-{{ transcoder_version }}"
        state: present
      register: update_result
      
    # CRITICAL BUG: This caused infinite loop
    - name: Restart services if update failed
      include_tasks: main.yml  # This includes the entire playbook recursively!
      when: update_result is failed
```

**Timeline of the Disaster**:
*8:00 PM* - Playbook execution starts during low-traffic period
*8:15 PM* - First batch of servers enters infinite loop due to package installation failure
*8:30 PM* - CPU usage spikes to 100% on affected servers
*8:45 PM* - Servers become unresponsive, load balancer removes them from rotation
*9:00 PM* - Remaining servers overwhelmed with traffic, start cascading failures
*9:30 PM* - Complete streaming service outage during prime time viewing hours
*10:15 PM* - Emergency manual intervention begins
*2:30 AM* - All services restored after manual server recovery

**Impact Metrics**:
- 6.5 hours of streaming service disruption
- 15 million users affected during prime viewing time

## Security & Compliance

### Security Fundamentals in Infrastructure as Code

Security in IaC requires a shift from traditional perimeter-based security to a "security as code" approach where security controls are embedded throughout the infrastructure lifecycle.

### Secret Management in IaC

**The Challenge**:
Traditional IaC implementations often suffer from secret sprawl, where sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and certificates are stored in plain text within configuration files.

**Industry-Standard Solutions**:

**AWS Secrets Manager Integration**:
```hcl
# Terraform example for secure secret management
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "database_password" {
  name = "production/database/master-password"
  description = "Master password for production RDS instance"
  
  # Enable automatic rotation
  rotation_lambda_arn = aws_lambda_function.password_rotation.arn
  rotation_rules {
    automatically_after_days = 30
  }
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    SecretType = "database-credential"
    Compliance = "pci-dss"
  }
}

# Generate secure password
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "database_password" {
  secret_id = aws_secretsmanager_secret.database_password.id
  secret_string = jsonencode({
    username = "dbadmin"
    password = random_password.master_password.result
  })
}

resource "random_password" "master_password" {
  length  = 32
  special = true
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}

# RDS instance using secret
resource "aws_db_instance" "production_db" {
  identifier = "production-database"
  
  engine         = "postgres"
  engine_version = "14.6"
  instance_class = "db.r5.xlarge"
  
  allocated_storage     = 100
  max_allocated_storage = 1000
  storage_encrypted     = true
  kms_key_id           = aws_kms_key.rds_encryption.arn
  
  # Retrieve credentials from Secrets Manager
  manage_master_user_password = true
  master_user_secret_kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.secrets_encryption.arn
  
  backup_retention_period = 30
  backup_window          = "03:00-04:00"
  maintenance_window     = "sun:04:00-sun:05:00"
  
  # Security configurations
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.database.id]
  db_subnet_group_name   = aws_db_subnet_group.private.name
  
  # Enable logging
  enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports = ["postgresql"]
  
  # Prevent accidental deletion
  deletion_protection = true
  skip_final_snapshot = false
  final_snapshot_identifier = "production-db-final-snapshot-${formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD-hhmm", timestamp())}"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Backup = "critical"
    Encryption = "required"
  }
}
```

**HashiCorp Vault Integration**:
```python
# Pulumi example with Vault integration
import pulumi
import pulumi_vault as vault
import pulumi_aws as aws

# Configure Vault provider
vault_provider = vault.Provider("vault",
    address="https://vault.company.com",
    token=pulumi.Config().require_secret("vault_token")
)

# Create database secret in Vault
database_secret = vault.kv.SecretV2("db-secret",
    mount="secret",
    name="production/database",
    data_json=pulumi.Output.secret(json.dumps({
        "username": "dbadmin",
        "password": "generated-secure-password",
        "host": "db.company.internal",
        "port": "5432"
    })),
    opts=pulumi.ResourceOptions(provider=vault_provider)
)

# Lambda function that retrieves secrets from Vault
lambda_function = aws.lambda_.Function("api-server",
    runtime="python3.9",
    code=pulumi.AssetArchive({
        ".": pulumi.FileArchive("./lambda-package.zip")
    }),
    handler="main.lambda_handler",
    role=lambda_role.arn,
    environment={
        "variables": {
            "VAULT_ADDR": "https://vault.company.com",
            "SECRET_PATH": "secret/production/database",
            "AWS_REGION": "ap-south-1"
        }
    },
    vpc_config={
        "subnet_ids": private_subnet_ids,
        "security_group_ids": [lambda_security_group.id]
    }
)
```

### Compliance as Code

**Regulatory Compliance in Indian Context**:

Indian companies must comply with various regulations including RBI guidelines for financial services, CERT-In requirements for critical infrastructure, and data localization requirements.

**RBI Compliance Example**:
```yaml

      loop: "{{ allowed_network_rules }}"
    
    - name: Block all other traffic (default deny)
      iptables:

        policy: DROP
        
    - name: Setup continuous monitoring
      cron:
