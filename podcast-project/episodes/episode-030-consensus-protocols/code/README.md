## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why Mumbai analogies?

**A:** Mumbai's complex systems (local trains, traffic, housing societies) mirror distributed system challenges perfectly. The analogies make complex concepts relatable and memorable.

### Q: Can I use these examples in production?

**A:** These are educational examples. For production, use mature libraries like:
- **Raft**: etcd, Consul
- **pBFT**: Hyperledger Fabric
- **Blockchain**: Bitcoin Core, Ethereum

### Q: What about scalability?

**A:** Examples are designed for learning (10-100 nodes). Production systems handle thousands of nodes with optimizations not shown here.

### Q: How accurate are the Mumbai simulations?

**A:** We've modeled realistic network conditions, power issues, and reliability patterns based on Mumbai infrastructure characteristics.
