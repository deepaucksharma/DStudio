## ðŸŽ¯ CONSOLIDATION SUCCESSFUL

All podcast work is now in ONE location: `podcast-project/`

### What Was Moved:
1. **episodes/** â†’ `podcast-project/episodes/`
2. **podcast-code-examples/** â†’ Merged and archived
3. **Documentation files** â†’ `podcast-project/documentation/`
4. **Master files** â†’ `podcast-project/` root
5. **archive/** â†’ `podcast-project/archive/old-archive/`

### New Structure:
```
podcast-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ PODCAST_MASTER_TRACKER.md      âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ STREAMLINED_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                      âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                      âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ episodes/                      âœ… (15 episodes)
â”œâ”€â”€ documentation/                 âœ… (all reports)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                       âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ shared-resources/              âœ…
â””â”€â”€ archive/                       âœ…
```

### Updated Paths for Agents:
- Research: `podcast-project/episodes/episode-XXX/research/research-notes.md`
- Script: `podcast-project/episodes/episode-XXX/script/episode-script.md`
- Code: `podcast-project/episodes/episode-XXX/code/`

### Next Steps:
1. cd podcast-project/
2. Check PODCAST_MASTER_TRACKER.md for status
3. Use STREAMLINED_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md for production
4. All future work happens here only
