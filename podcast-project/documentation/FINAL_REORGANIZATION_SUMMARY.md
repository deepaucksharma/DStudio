## 📁 CLEANUP COMMANDS

After verifying all files are in new locations, run:

```bash
# Remove duplicate research files from root
rm indian-context-research-episode1-probability-system-failures.md
rm episode-2-indian-context-research.md
rm episode-10-graph-analytics-research.md
rm episode-12-airflow-workflow-orchestration-research.md
rm episode-15-dataops-pipeline-automation-research.md

# Remove old research files from podcast-code-examples
rm -rf podcast-code-examples/episode-01-probability-system-failures/docs/
rm podcast-code-examples/episode-7-service-mesh-research.md
rm podcast-code-examples/episode-8-api-gateway-research.md
rm podcast-code-examples/research-episode-10-distributed-tracing-observability.md

# Remove old research from repository-assets
