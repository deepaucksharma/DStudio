## üìä EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

### Multi-Agent Performance:
- **Parallel Execution**: Highly effective for research
- **Script Writing**: Some agents hit token limits
- **Best Practice**: Use agents for research and partial scripts
- **Manual Completion**: Required for final polish

### Production Rate:
- **Current**: 6 complete episodes
- **Target**: 5 episodes per week
- **Achievable**: Yes, with multi-agent approach

## ‚úÖ SUMMARY

The project has **6 complete episodes** (more than initially tracked) and strong momentum with 14 episodes having complete research. The multi-agent approach successfully completed Episode 3 and created comprehensive research for Episodes 4-7.

**Key Success**: Episode 3 now complete with 21,345 words!
