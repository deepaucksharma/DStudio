## üí° LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well:
1. **Breaking episodes into parts** to avoid token limits
2. **Mumbai metaphors** resonated throughout (local trains, dabbawalas, traffic)
3. **Indian company examples** provided strong relatability
4. **Production code examples** added practical value

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. Consider writing episodes in 2-3 parts to manage token limits
2. Prepare research documents first for all episodes
3. Create code examples repository in advance
