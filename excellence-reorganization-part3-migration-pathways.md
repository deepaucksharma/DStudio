# Excellence Reorganization Part 3: Migration Pathways Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive migration pathways from Bronze/Legacy patterns to Gold/Silver patterns, including readiness assessments, week-by-week plans, and success criteria.

## Migration Framework

### Four-Phase Migration Process
```
┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌────────────┐
│ Assessment  │ → │ Planning  │ → │ Execution │ → │ Validation │
└─────────────┘    └──────────┘    └───────────┘    └────────────┘
     Week 1          Week 2-3        Week 4-12        Week 13+
```

### Migration Complexity Levels
- **Low**: 2-4 weeks, single team, low risk
- **Medium**: 4-8 weeks, multiple teams, moderate risk
- **High**: 8-16 weeks, organization-wide, high risk
- **Very High**: 16+ weeks, multi-phase, critical systems

## Bronze Pattern Deprecation

### Patterns to Retire

#### 1. Vector Clocks → Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)
```yaml
motivation:
  - Smaller timestamp size
  - Wall-clock correlation
  - Easier debugging

migration:
  - Install HLC library
  - Update timestamp fields
  - Convert existing timestamps
  - Test ordering guarantees
```

#### 2. Gossip Protocol → Service Mesh
```yaml
from:
  - Peer-to-peer gossip
  - Eventual convergence
  - Complex debugging

to:
  - Centralized control plane
  - Instant updates
  - Observable state
```

#### 3. Anti-Entropy → CRDT
```yaml
from:
  - Periodic reconciliation
  - Custom merge logic
  - Conflict detection

to:
  - Automatic merging
  - Mathematically proven
  - No conflicts
```
