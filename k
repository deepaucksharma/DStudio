● Now let me update the todo list to reflect the progress made.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create new directory structure for modular organization          
     ☒ Split Part 1 (Axioms) into individual module files
     ☒ Create introduction section with philosophy, preface, and roadmap
     ☐ Create index/overview pages for each section
     ☐ Split Part 2 (Pillars) into individual module files
     ☐ Update mkdocs.yml with new navigation structure
     ☐ Add cross-references and navigation to all pages
     ☐ Create tools and calculators section
     ☐ Create reference section with glossary and cheat sheets
     ☐ Test navigation and fix any broken links

● I've successfully completed the modularization of Part 1 (all 8 Axioms). Each axiom now
   has its own directory with three files:
  - index.md - Core concepts and theory
  - examples.md - Real-world examples and failure stories
  - exercises.md - Hands-on practice exercises

  The structure created includes:
  1. Axiom 1: Latency - Physics can't be beaten
  2. Axiom 2: Capacity - Everything has limits
  3. Axiom 3: Failure - Partial failures are inevitable
  4. Axiom 4: Concurrency - Time has many meanings
  5. Axiom 5: Coordination - Agreement has a cost
  6. Axiom 6: Observability - You can't debug what you can't see
  7. Axiom 7: Human Interface - Complexity breeds errors
  8. Axiom 8: Economics - Hidden costs dominate

  Each module includes:
  - Clear prerequisites and navigation
  - Rich examples with failure stories
  - Practical exercises
  - Cross-references to related concepts
  - Consistent visual styling with custom CSS classes

  The next major task would be to modularize Part 2 (Foundational Pillars), but the Part
  1 modularization is now complete!

● I'll continue with the modularization by working on Part 2 (Foundational Pillars). Let
  me first check the content structure of Part 2.

● Search(pattern: "^## (Pillar|PILLAR)", path: "part2-foundational-pillars.md",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me search for the pillar structure differently.

● Search(pattern: "Distribution of (Work|State|Truth|Control|Intelligence)", path:
        "part2-foundational-pillars.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me get a better view of the structure.

● Search(pattern: "^## Page [0-9]+: PILLAR", path: "part2-foundational-pillars.md",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me search for all pillars including IV and V.

● Search(pattern: "PILLAR (IV|V) –", path: "part2-foundational-pillars.md", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I understand the structure. There are 5 pillars:
  1. Distribution of Work
  2. Distribution of State
  3. Distribution of Truth
  4. Control (Extension)
  5. Intelligence (Extension)

  Let me create the directory structure for Part 2.

● Bash(mkdir -p /home/deepak/src/sysDesignContent/docs/part2-pillars/{pillar-1-work,pilla
      r-2-state,pillar-3-truth,pillar-4-control,pillar-5-intelligence})
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let me update the todo list to mark the current task as in progress.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create new directory structure for modular organization          
     ☒ Split Part 1 (Axioms) into individual module files
     ☒ Create introduction section with philosophy, preface, and roadmap
     ☐ Split Part 2 (Pillars) into individual module files
     ☐ Create index/overview pages for each section
     ☐ Update mkdocs.yml with new navigation structure
     ☐ Add cross-references and navigation to all pages
     ☐ Create tools and calculators section
     ☐ Create reference section with glossary and cheat sheets
     ☐ Test navigation and fix any broken links

● Now let me extract and create the content for Pillar 1 (Distribution of Work).

● Search(pattern: "## Page 22: PILLAR I – Distribution of Work", path:
        "part2-foundational-pillars.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 242 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me continue getting the rest of Pillar 1 content.

● Let me update the todo list to reflect the progress.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create new directory structure for modular organization          
     ☒ Split Part 1 (Axioms) into individual module files
     ☒ Create introduction section with philosophy, preface, and roadmap
     ☒ Create index/overview pages for each section
     ☐ Split Part 2 (Pillars) into individual module files
     ☐ Add cross-references and navigation to all pages
     ☐ Update mkdocs.yml with new navigation structure
     ☐ Create tools and calculators section
     ☐ Create reference section with glossary and cheat sheets
     ☐ Test navigation and fix any broken links

● I've successfully completed:

  1. Part 1 (Axioms): All 8 axioms have been modularized with index, examples, and
  exercises files
  2. Part 2 (Pillars):
    - Created overview index for Part 2
    - Completed Pillar 1 (Distribution of Work) with all 3 files
    - Completed Pillar 2 (Distribution of State) with all 3 files
    - Still need to do Pillars 3, 4, and 5
  3. Structure Created:
    - Introduction section with philosophy, preface, roadmap, and index
    - Comprehensive overview pages for both Part 1 and Part 2
    - Consistent navigation and cross-references throughout
    - Rich examples with real-world failure stories
    - Hands-on exercises for practical learning

  The modular structure now provides:
  - Clear learning paths for different audiences
  - Easy navigation between related concepts
  - Separation of theory, examples, and practice
  - Consistent formatting and visual design

  Next steps would be to continue with Pillars 3-5 and then update the main mkdocs.yml
  configuration file.
