## Quality Checklist for Each Case Study

- [ ] All 8 axioms explicitly addressed with concrete examples
- [ ] All 5 pillars mapped to system components
- [ ] At least 10 patterns identified and analyzed

- [ ] Production metrics and real numbers
- [ ] Failure scenarios and mitigations

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Superficial Analysis**: Don't just mention concepts, show deep understanding
2. **Missing Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros and cons
3. **Ignoring Operations**: Design for Day 2 operations
4. **Perfect World Syndrome**: Account for failures and edge cases
5. **Over-Engineering**: Start simple, evolve with requirements
6. **Hand-Waving**: Use concrete numbers and examples
7. **Single Solution**: Always present alternatives
8. **Forgetting Humans**: Consider operator and developer experience

## Expected Depth Example

Instead of: "Use caching for performance"

Write: "Implement a three-tier cache hierarchy:
- L1: In-process cache (0.01ms, 100MB, LRU eviction)
- L2: Redis cluster (0.5ms, 10GB, allkeys-lru policy)  
- L3: CDN edge cache (10ms, 1TB, TTL-based expiration)

Cache warming strategies:
- Predictive warming based on access patterns
- Lazy loading with cache-aside pattern
- Write-through for critical data

Cache invalidation via:
- TTL for immutable data (5min for user profiles)
- Event-driven invalidation for mutable data
- Versioned keys for atomic updates"

This guide ensures each case study becomes a comprehensive learning resource that demonstrates mastery of distributed systems concepts.
