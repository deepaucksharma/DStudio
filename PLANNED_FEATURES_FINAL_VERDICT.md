# Planned Features - Final Verdict

**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Analysis Complete:** What should be fixed vs what should be planned

## Executive Summary

Of 1,586 "missing" links:
- **~700 are BROKEN REFERENCES** that need fixing, not new content
- **~300 are LEGITIMATE PLANNED FEATURES** worth considering
- **~586 need INDIVIDUAL REVIEW** to determine action

## Immediate Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Just Fixed: Pattern Library Categories (52 references)
Fixed pattern references missing categories:
- `../pattern-library/circuit-breaker` ‚Üí `../pattern-library/resilience/circuit-breaker`
- `../pattern-library/saga` ‚Üí `../pattern-library/data-management/saga`

This reduced unrecognized links by 52.

## Categories Analysis

### 1. ‚ùå NOT Planned Features - Need Fixes (~700 links)

#### Pattern Library References (~643 remaining)
**Issue:** Missing category in path
**Fix:** Add category directory to path
**Status:** 52 fixed, ~643 more to investigate

#### Anchor Link Format Issues (~50 links)
**Issue:** `file.md#anchor` should be `file/#anchor`
**Example:** `core-principles/index/#learning-paths.md`
**Fix:** Remove `.md` before anchors

#### Incorrect Relative Paths (~30 links)
**Issue:** `../../../scenarios.md` pointing to wrong location
**Fix:** Correct the relative path

### 2. ‚úÖ LEGITIMATE Planned Features (~300 links)

#### High Value Additions

**Implementation Playbooks (8 references)**
- Monolith to Microservices Guide
- Zero-Downtime Migration Playbook
- Multi-Region Deployment Guide
**Verdict:** Would provide significant practical value

**Engineering Leadership Templates (7 references)**
- 1:1 Meeting Template
- Performance Review Framework
- Career Development Plan
**Verdict:** Valuable for leadership section

**Interactive Calculators (7 references)**
- Latency Calculator
- CAP Theorem Calculator
- Capacity Planning Tool
**Verdict:** Enhance learning experience

**Best Practices Guides (6 references)**
- Remote Team Management
- Inclusive Leadership
- Burnout Prevention
**Verdict:** Relevant to modern engineering

#### Medium Value Additions

**Quantitative Analysis Topics (39 references)**
- Latency Ladder
- Universal Scalability Law
- Performance Modeling
**Verdict:** Some may duplicate existing content, needs review

**Additional Guides (82 references)**
- Real-Time Systems Guide
- Geo-Distributed Systems
- Mobile Optimization
**Verdict:** Useful but lower priority

### 3. üîç Need Investigation (~586 links)

These require checking if:
- Content exists under different names
- Links have wrong paths
- Content is actually valuable

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Broken References (High Priority)
1. **Fix remaining pattern library paths** (~643 links)
2. **Fix anchor link formatting** (~50 links)
3. **Fix relative path errors** (~30 links)

**Impact:** Removes ~700 false "missing content" warnings

### Phase 2: Create High-Value Content (Medium Priority)
Focus on content that provides immediate value:

1. **Implementation Playbooks**
   - Practical, actionable guides
   - High user demand

2. **Leadership Templates**
   - Direct utility for managers
   - Easy to create

3. **Key Calculators**
   - Interactive learning tools
   - Can start with simple versions

### Phase 3: Evaluate Remaining (Low Priority)
For the ~586 uncertain links:
1. Check if content exists elsewhere
2. Determine user value
3. Either fix path or add to backlog

## Bottom Line

**Most "planned features" are actually broken links that need fixing, not new content to create.**

### Breakdown:
- **44% are broken references** (fix the path)
- **19% are valuable planned features** (selectively implement)
- **37% need investigation** (may be duplicates or low value)

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the ~700 broken references first
2. Create stub pages for high-value planned content
3. Add "Coming Soon" notices rather than broken links
4. Focus new content on highest-impact additions

**Key Insight:** Don't create 1,586 new pages. Fix ~700 broken links and selectively add ~50-100 high-value pages.
