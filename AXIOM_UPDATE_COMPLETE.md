- Updated human factors files (Postmortems, On-Call Culture, etc.)
- All axiom references mapped to appropriate laws

## Key Statistics

- **Total Files Updated**: 30+
- **References Changed**: 100+
- **Old Directories Archived**: 8
- **New Law Structure**: 7 laws with emojis

## New Law Structure Summary

1. ⛓️ **Law of Correlated Failure** - Dependencies amplify failures
2. ⏳ **Law of Asynchronous Reality** - Information has uncertainty
3. 🌪️ **Law of Emergent Chaos** - Complexity emerges at scale
4. ⚖️ **Law of Multidimensional Optimization** - N-dimensional trade-offs
5. 🧠 **Law of Distributed Knowledge** - Partial knowledge everywhere
6. 🤯 **Law of Cognitive Load** - Human capacity limits
7. 💰 **Law of Economic Reality** - Everything has a cost

## Validation Checklist

✅ No references to "8 axioms" remain  
✅ All navigation links work correctly  
✅ All patterns reference correct laws  
✅ All case studies use new terminology  
✅ mkdocs.yml navigation is updated  
✅ Old axiom directories are archived  
✅ Mapping guide is available for reference  

## Next Steps

1. **Content Enhancement**: Some new axiom files (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) already have full content but could benefit from review
2. **Search Index**: Rebuild the search index to reflect new structure
3. **External Links**: Check any external documentation that might reference the old structure
4. **User Communication**: Consider adding a migration notice for returning users

## Migration Success

The transition has been completed successfully with:
- **Zero broken links** (all paths updated)
- **Consistent terminology** throughout
- **Preserved content value** while enhancing framework
- **Clear mapping** for future reference
