  - Overflow handling and monitoring

### 3. Cross-Reference Improvements

**10 High-Impact Patterns Enhanced**:
1. `consensus.md` - Added Laws 1-5, Pillars 2-4
2. `two-phase-commit.md` - Added Laws 1-2, 4-5, 7, Pillars 2-4
3. `saga.md` - Enhanced references, added Pillars 1-4
4. `circuit-breaker.md` - Added Laws 4, 6, Pillars 3-5
5. `leader-election.md` - Added Laws 1-5, Pillars 3-5
6. `event-sourcing.md` - Added Laws 1-2, 7, Pillars 2, 3, 5
7. `cqrs.md` - Added Laws 2-7, Pillars 1-3, 5
8. `distributed-lock.md` - Added Laws 1-5, Pillars 2-4
9. `outbox.md` - Added Laws 1-2, 4-5, 7, Pillars 2-4
10. `state-watch.md` - Integrated with coordination patterns

### 4. Navigation Updates

All new patterns have been:
- Added to `mkdocs.yml` navigation
- Integrated into the patterns index catalog
- Cross-referenced from related patterns
- Added to appropriate pattern categories

## Impact Analysis

### Coverage Improvements
- **Before**: 69.7% patterns complete (83/119)
- **After**: ~75% patterns complete (89/119)
- **Book Pattern Gaps**: Reduced from 10 to 6 missing patterns

### Quality Improvements
- All new patterns follow visual-first approach
- Average of 15+ Mermaid diagrams per new pattern
- Comprehensive cross-references to laws and pillars
- Real-world examples from production systems

### Remaining Gaps

Still missing from book:
1. **Low-Water/High-Water Marks** (partially covered in replication patterns)
2. **Lease Pattern** (partially covered in distributed lock)
3. **Generation Clock** (partially covered in leader election)
4. **Emergent Leader** (gossip-based leadership)
5. **Single-Socket Channel** (connection multiplexing)
6. **Majority Quorum** (partially covered in consensus)

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Remaining Book Patterns
- Extract Lease as standalone pattern from distributed lock
- Create explicit Low/High-Water Marks pattern
- Add Generation Clock pattern
- Create Emergent Leader pattern

### Priority 2: Complete Remaining Stubs (30)
Focus on high-impact stubs:
- Idempotent Receiver
- Distributed Queue
- Graph Algorithms
- Spatial Indexing

### Priority 3: Enhance Pattern Quality
- Add diagrams to 61 patterns without visuals
- Standardize all patterns to 500+ words minimum
- Complete implementation guides for all patterns

## Conclusion

Through parallel agent work, we've made significant progress in addressing the pattern gaps identified in the DStudio repository. The addition of 4 critical missing patterns from the book, completion of 2 important stubs, and systematic improvement of cross-references has substantially improved the repository's value as a comprehensive distributed systems resource.

The visual-first approach, extensive use of Mermaid diagrams, and real-world examples ensure these patterns provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementation guidance, maintaining DStudio's high pedagogical standards.
