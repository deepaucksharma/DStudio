## üé® Content Quality Standards

### Writing Principles
1. **Density over verbosity** - Every sentence adds value
2. **Visual over textual** - Diagrams > descriptions
3. **Practical over theoretical** - Real examples required
4. **Scannable format** - Headers, bullets, tables

### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] Verify all performance numbers
- [ ] Test all code examples
- [ ] Validate architectural diagrams
- [ ] Cross-check with latest documentation

### Consistency Requirements
- Use "Laws" not "Axioms" throughout
- Reference format: `[Law 1: Correlated Failure](/part1-axioms/law1-failure/)`
- Mermaid diagram style: consistent colors and shapes
- Trade-off tables: always include Performance, Complexity, Reliability

## üë• Team Structure

### Suggested Roles
1. **Content Lead** - Owns roadmap and quality
2. **Pattern Authors** (2-3) - Focus on patterns section
3. **Case Study Authors** (2-3) - Real-world examples
4. **Tool Developer** (1) - Interactive calculators
5. **Reviewer** (1) - Quality assurance

### Review Process
1. Author creates content following template
2. Self-review against checklist
3. Peer review by another author
