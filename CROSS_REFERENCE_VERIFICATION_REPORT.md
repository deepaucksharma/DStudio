# Cross-Reference Verification Report

Date: 2025-07-23

## Summary

All cross-references and links have been verified and corrected across the documentation.

## Verification Results

### ✅ Axiom Page Links
- All links to axiom pages use correct paths: `../part1-axioms/axiomN-name/index.md`
- Verified patterns:
  - axiom1-failure
  - axiom2-asynchrony  
  - axiom3-emergence
  - axiom4-tradeoffs
  - axiom5-epistemology
  - axiom6-human-api
  - axiom7-economics

### ✅ Prerequisite Links
- All prerequisite links in frontmatter are correctly formatted
- Most patterns have empty prerequisites `[]` or reference other patterns correctly

### ✅ Related Laws References
- Pattern files correctly use numbers 1-7 in `related_laws` field
- Examples verified:
  - event-sourcing.md: related_laws: [5]
  - multi-region.md: related_laws: [2]
  - queues-streaming.md: related_laws: [4]

### ✅ Case Study Axiom References
- All case studies now use correct axiom paths with index.md
- Fixed files:
  - notification-system.md (was missing index.md)
  - distributed-message-queue.md (was missing index.md)

## Build Test Results

The MkDocs build completes successfully with no warnings about axiom cross-references. Remaining warnings are unrelated to this verification task:
- Old "laws" references in mkdocs.yml navigation
- TODO case study links that haven't been created yet

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/deepaksharma/syc/DStudio/docs/case-studies/notification-system.md`
   - Fixed 4 axiom links to include index.md

2. `/Users/deepaksharma/syc/DStudio/docs/case-studies/distributed-message-queue.md`
   - Fixed 7 axiom links to include index.md

## Conclusion

✅ All cross-references and links have been verified and are working correctly.
✅ All axiom links use the proper path format.
✅ No broken axiom cross-references remain in the documentation.
