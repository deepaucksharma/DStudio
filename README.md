# The Compendium of Distributed Systems 📚

A first-principles approach to understanding distributed systems, deriving patterns from fundamental physical and mathematical constraints rather than memorizing solutions.

## 🎯 Philosophy

This project takes a unique approach to teaching distributed systems:

- **Physics First**: We start with the speed of light, not with Kafka
- **Math Over Mythology**: Quantitative trade-offs replace "best practices"
- **Failures as Teachers**: Real production disasters illuminate principles
- **Derive, Don't Memorize**: Every pattern emerges from fundamental constraints
