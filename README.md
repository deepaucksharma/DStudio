# DStudio - The Compendium of Distributed Systems

A comprehensive, visual-first learning platform for distributed systems, teaching from first principles through physics and mathematics rather than specific technologies.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start development server
mkdocs serve

# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## 📚 What is DStudio?

DStudio is an educational resource that teaches distributed systems through:

- **8 Fundamental Axioms**: Starting from physics (speed of light, thermodynamics)
- **5 Foundational Pillars**: Building up to practical system design
- **30+ Patterns**: Modern architectural patterns with visual explanations
- **40+ Case Studies**: Real-world systems analyzed and visualized
- **800+ Visual Diagrams**: Complex concepts made accessible

## 🎨 Visual-First Approach

This documentation has been transformed to prioritize visual learning:

- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state machines
- **Architecture Visualizations**: System designs and data flows
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Formulas and graphs made intuitive
- **Cross-References**: 330+ interconnections between concepts

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run development server (auto-reload enabled)
mkdocs serve

# Build static site
mkdocs build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

### Key Files

- `mkdocs.yml` - Site configuration and navigation
- `docs/stylesheets/extra.css` - Custom styling (784 lines)
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## 🎯 Learning Paths

The documentation supports multiple learning approaches:

1. **New Graduate Path**: Start with axioms, build up slowly
2. **Senior Engineer Path**: Jump to patterns and case studies
3. **Manager Path**: Focus on trade-offs and human factors
4. **Express Path**: Quick overview of key concepts

## ✨ Features

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Content complexity increases gradually
- **Real Failure Stories**: Learn from production disasters
- **Interactive Elements**: Calculators and decision trees
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Same concept explained different ways
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices

## 📊 Visual Conversion Statistics
