# DStudio - The Compendium of Distributed Systems

A comprehensive, interactive learning platform for distributed systems with **Excellence Framework** - teaching from first principles through physics and mathematics, now enhanced with pattern quality tiers and real-world scale examples.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start development server
mkdocs serve

# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## 📚 What is DStudio?

DStudio is an educational resource that teaches distributed systems through:

- **7 Fundamental Laws**: Starting from physics (speed of light, thermodynamics)
- **5 Foundational Pillars**: Building up to practical system design
- **95 Patterns**: Classified by excellence tiers (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- **40+ Case Studies**: Real-world systems analyzed and visualized
- **800+ Visual Diagrams**: Complex concepts made accessible

## ✨ NEW: Excellence Framework

DStudio now features an interactive pattern discovery system:

### 🎯 Pattern Excellence Tiers
- **🥇 Gold (38)**: Battle-tested at 100M+ scale (Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn)
- **🥈 Silver (38)**: Proven with trade-offs documented
- **🥉 Bronze (19)**: Legacy patterns with migration guides

### 🔍 Interactive Features
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter patterns by tier, search by name
- **Health Dashboard**: Real-time pattern adoption metrics
- **Migration Guides**: Step-by-step paths from legacy to modern
- **Scale Examples**: Real company implementations with metrics

## 🎨 Visual-First Approach

This documentation has been transformed to prioritize visual learning:

- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state machines
- **Architecture Visualizations**: System designs and data flows
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Formulas and graphs made intuitive
- **Cross-References**: 330+ interconnections between concepts
