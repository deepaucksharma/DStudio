## Remaining Issues (374 links)

The remaining broken links fall into these categories:

### 1. Missing Files (Need Creation)

- Template examples with placeholder links

### 3. Complex Path Issues
- Some deeply nested relative paths
- Cross-module references that need manual review

## Recommendations

1. **Content Review**: Review the 374 remaining broken links to determine if files should be created or links updated
2. **CI Integration**: Add link verification to your CI/CD pipeline
3. **Link Guidelines**: Document linking conventions for contributors
4. **Regular Checks**: Run link verification regularly as part of maintenance

## Success Metrics

- Automated 58% of link fixes without manual intervention
- Created reusable tools for ongoing maintenance
- Established patterns for common link issues
- Reduced manual effort significantly

The remaining 374 broken links require human decisions about whether to:
- Create the missing content
- Update the links to point to existing content
- Remove the links if they're no longer relevant
