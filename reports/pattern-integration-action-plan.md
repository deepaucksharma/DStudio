# Pattern Integration Action Plan

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Add Missing Gold-Tier Patterns to Navigation

#### Consensus Pattern
**File**: `docs/patterns/consensus.md`
**Add to**: mkdocs.yml under "Data Patterns" section
```yaml
- Data Patterns:
  # ... existing patterns ...
  - State Watch: patterns/state-watch.md
  - Consensus: patterns/consensus.md  # ADD THIS LINE
  - Logical Clocks: patterns/logical-clocks.md
```

#### Publish-Subscribe Pattern
**File**: `docs/patterns/publish-subscribe.md`
**Add to**: mkdocs.yml under "Communication Patterns" section
```yaml
- Communication Patterns:
  # ... existing patterns ...
  - Message Queue: patterns/distributed-queue.md
  - Publish-Subscribe: patterns/publish-subscribe.md  # ADD THIS LINE
  - Service Mesh: patterns/service-mesh.md
```

### 2. Update Pattern Metadata

The following patterns need excellence_tier added to their frontmatter:

#### Service Discovery Pattern
**File**: `docs/patterns/service-discovery.md`
**Add to frontmatter**:
```yaml
excellence_tier: silver
pattern_status: use-with-expertise
introduced: 2008-01
current_relevance: mainstream
modern_examples:
  - company: Netflix
    implementation: "Eureka for service discovery across thousands of microservices"
    scale: "8000+ service instances discovered dynamically"
  - company: Kubernetes
    implementation: "Native service discovery via DNS and service objects"
    scale: "Powers millions of containerized applications"
production_checklist:
  - "Choose discovery mechanism (client-side vs server-side)"
  - "Configure health check intervals (typically 5-30s)"
  - "Set up service registration on startup"
  - "Implement graceful deregistration on shutdown"
  - "Configure circuit breakers for discovery failures"
  - "Monitor discovery latency and cache hit rates"
related_laws: [law1-failure, law2-asynchrony, law5-epistemology]
related_pillars: [work, truth]
```

#### Polyglot Persistence Pattern
**File**: `docs/patterns/polyglot-persistence.md`
**Add to frontmatter**:
```yaml
excellence_tier: silver
pattern_status: use-with-expertise
introduced: 2011-01
current_relevance: mainstream
modern_examples:
  - company: Netflix
    implementation: "Uses Cassandra, MySQL, Redis, S3 for different data needs"
    scale: "Manages PBs of data across specialized stores"
  - company: Uber
    implementation: "MySQL for transactions, Cassandra for analytics, Redis for caching"
    scale: "Processes millions of trips with optimized storage"
production_checklist:
  - "Map data types to appropriate storage engines"
  - "Design cross-store consistency strategy"
  - "Implement data synchronization mechanisms"
  - "Plan for cross-store queries and joins"
  - "Monitor storage costs and performance"
  - "Document data location strategy"
related_laws: [law4-tradeoffs, law7-economics]
related_pillars: [state, truth]
```

#### Backends for Frontends Pattern
**File**: `docs/patterns/backends-for-frontends.md`
**Add to frontmatter**:
```yaml
category: communication
excellence_tier: silver
pattern_status: use-with-expertise
introduced: 2015-01
current_relevance: mainstream
modern_examples:
  - company: Netflix
    implementation: "Separate BFFs for web, mobile, TV clients"
    scale: "Serves 200M+ users across diverse devices"
  - company: SoundCloud
    implementation: "BFF layer optimizes for mobile bandwidth constraints"
    scale: "175M+ tracks streamed on various clients"
production_checklist:
  - "Define clear ownership for each BFF"
  - "Avoid business logic duplication across BFFs"
  - "Implement shared libraries for common functionality"
  - "Monitor BFF-specific metrics and performance"
  - "Plan for BFF versioning and deprecation"
related_laws: [law4-tradeoffs, law6-human-api]
related_pillars: [work, control]
```

### 3. Complete Publish-Subscribe Content

The publish-subscribe pattern has `status: initial` and needs content completion. The pattern should follow the standard 5-level structure:
- Level 1: Intuition
- Level 2: Foundation  
- Level 3: Deep Dive
- Level 4: Expert
- Level 5: Mastery

Use the existing metadata which is already excellent, and model after the distributed-queue pattern for consistency.

## Verification Steps

After making changes:

1. **Run navigation check**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check-navigation.py
   ```

2. **Verify with mkdocs serve**:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   # Check that new patterns appear in navigation
   ```

3. **Update pattern health dashboard** to reflect new patterns

## Impact Summary

- **2 Gold-tier patterns** will be properly accessible
- **3 patterns** will have complete metadata for excellence framework
- **Navigation** will be complete for all high-value patterns
- **Pattern discovery** will be improved for users

## Timeline

- Immediate (Today): Add consensus and publish-subscribe to navigation
- Next Sprint: Update metadata for 3 patterns
- Following Sprint: Complete publish-subscribe content if needed
