   - Comprehensive reporting
   - JSON output for automation

2. **Metadata Fix Script**
   - Automatically adds missing fields
   - Intelligent categorization
   - Tier determination logic

3. **CI/CD Workflow**
   - Automatic validation on PR/push
   - Fails on broken links
   - Coverage monitoring

4. **Pre-commit Hook**
   - Local validation before commit
   - New file warnings
   - Quick feedback loop

## 📝 Documentation Added

- Navigation Maintenance Guide
