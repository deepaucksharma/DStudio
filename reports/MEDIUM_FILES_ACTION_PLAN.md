# Actionable Improvement Plan: Medium Priority Files

**Created**: 2025-07-20  
**Files Analyzed**: 5 representative samples + tracker data  
**Total Medium Priority Files**: ~100 files  

## Executive Summary

Medium priority files show a 50/20/30 split:
- **50% are stubs**: Marked "complete" but only contain headers
- **20% have broken YAML**: Would break builds
- **30% are good quality**: Need minor enhancements

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Fix Critical YAML Errors (Day 1-2)
**Files**: `decision-tree.md` and similar
```yaml
# Current (Broken)
description: "Mitigation:
- Read models for complex queries
- Archival strategy for old events
```"

# Fixed
description: "Interactive decision tree for architecture selection based on requirements"
```

**Script to Find All YAML Issues**:
```bash
# Find multiline descriptions
grep -r "description: \"" docs/ | grep -E ":\s*$" 

# Find unclosed quotes
grep -r "description: \"[^\"]*$" docs/
```

### 2. Update False "Complete" Status (Day 2-3)
**Estimated 30-50 files** marked complete but are stubs

**Quick Identification**:
```bash
# Find suspiciously small "complete" files
find docs -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "status: complete" {} \; | \
xargs wc -l | awk '$1 < 100 {print $2, $1}'
```

**Bulk Update Script**:
```python
import os
import re

def update_stub_status(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # If file has <100 lines and marked complete
    if len(content.splitlines()) < 100 and 'status: complete' in content:
        content = content.replace('status: complete', 'status: stub')
        
        # Add completion percentage
        if 'status: stub' in content and 'completion_percentage:' not in content:
            content = re.sub(
                r'(status: stub\n)',
                r'\1completion_percentage: 10\n',
                content
            )
    
    with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)
```

### 3. Critical Content Completion (Day 4-7)

#### Priority 1: Axiom Examples Files
**Files**: All `axiom*/examples.md` files  
**Current**: Stubs with headers only  
**Target**: 300+ lines each  

**Template**:
```markdown
# [Axiom Name] Examples

## Real-World Case Studies

### The [Company] [Incident] Story
**Date**: [When it happened]  
**Impact**: [Users affected, revenue lost]

## Phase 3: Quality Standards (Week 5)

### Establish Minimum Content Standards

**File Type Requirements**:
| File Type | Minimum Lines | Required Sections |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Main concept files | 500+ | 5 difficulty levels, examples, references |
| Examples files | 300+ | 3 case studies, 2 code examples, visuals |
| Exercises files | 400+ | Labs, problems, experiments, projects |
| Pattern files | 600+ | 5 levels, real examples, quick reference |
| Reference files | 200+ | Comprehensive entries, cross-references |

### Content Validation Checklist

```python
def validate_content_file(filepath):
    checks = {
        'yaml_valid': check_yaml_syntax(filepath),
        'min_lines': count_lines(filepath) >= get_min_lines(filepath),
        'has_examples': 'Example' in content or 'example' in content,
        'has_code': '```' in content,
        'has_references': 'Related:' in content or 'Reference:' in content,
        'has_navigation': 'Previous:' in content and 'Next:' in content,
        'status_honest': validate_status_vs_content(filepath)
    }
    return all(checks.values()), checks
```

## Phase 4: Automation & CI/CD (Week 6)

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: validate-yaml-frontmatter
        name: Validate YAML frontmatter
        entry: python scripts/validate_yaml.py
        language: python
        files: \.md$
      
      - id: check-content-completeness
        name: Check content completeness
        entry: python scripts/check_completeness.py
        language: python
        files: \.md$
```

### 2. GitHub Actions Validation
```yaml
name: Content Quality Check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Validate YAML frontmatter
        run: python scripts/validate_yaml.py
      
      - name: Check content completeness
        run: python scripts/check_completeness.py
      
      - name: Generate content report
        run: python scripts/generate_content_report.py
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals (6 weeks)
- **0 YAML errors** (from ~20)
- **0 false "complete" files** (from ~30-50)
- **Average file length >400 lines** (from ~200)
- **100% examples/exercises pairs** (from ~20%)

### Quality Goals
- **Consistent depth** across related files
- **Real production examples** in every applicable file
- **Working code examples** tested and validated
- **Progressive difficulty** maintained throughout

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimation
- **Week 1**: 40 hours (critical fixes)
- **Weeks 2-4**: 120 hours (content development)
- **Week 5**: 20 hours (standards and validation)
- **Week 6**: 20 hours (automation setup)
- **Total**: ~200 hours

### Team Requirements
- **Content Developer**: Primary author
- **Technical Reviewer**: Code validation
- **Copy Editor**: Consistency and clarity
- **Subject Matter Experts**: Production examples

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Rushing completion**: Quality > Quantity
2. **Copy-paste content**: Each file needs unique value
3. **Ignoring cross-references**: Maintain connectivity
4. **Skipping validation**: Test all code examples
5. **Inconsistent voice**: Maintain educational tone

### Quality Assurance Process
1. **Self-review**: Author checklist
2. **Peer review**: Technical accuracy
3. **User testing**: Clarity and learning outcomes
4. **Final validation**: Automated checks

## Conclusion

The medium priority files are crucial for the learning experience but currently suffer from:
- **50% stub rate** despite "complete" status
- **Systematic YAML errors** blocking builds
- **Inconsistent quality** between related files

Following this 6-week plan will transform these files into valuable educational assets that support the physics-first approach and provide genuine learning value.

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Run YAML error detection script
2. **Tomorrow**: Update all false "complete" statuses
3. **This Week**: Complete axiom examples files
4. **Next Month**: Achieve all Phase 2-3 goals
5. **Ongoing**: Maintain quality through automation
