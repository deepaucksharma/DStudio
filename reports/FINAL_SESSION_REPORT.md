- **Structural requirements** (section organization by content type)  
- **Code quality** (language specifications, completeness)
- **Learning materials** (exercises, examples, solutions)
- **Link integrity** (no placeholders or broken references)

### Current Quality Distribution
- **37 files** (29%) are ‚â•80% complete (up from 11%)
- **92 files** (71%) still need improvement
- **Most common issues**: Missing axiom content, broken links, exercise solutions

### Validation Insights
1. **Pattern files** made massive improvement but validation may need refinement
2. **Axiom files** are the critical bottleneck (2-7% completion)
