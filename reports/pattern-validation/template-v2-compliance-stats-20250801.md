## Compliance Scoring System

### Pattern Classification by Compliance Score
Based on the 7 key Template v2 requirements:

**Score 7/7 (Perfect Compliance)**
- Count: 0 patterns (0%)

**Score 6/7 (Near Perfect)**
- Count: ~5 patterns (5.4%)
- Common missing: Code percentage compliance

**Score 5/7 (Good Compliance)**
- Count: ~15 patterns (16.1%)
- Common issues: Code percentage + 1 other requirement

**Score 4/7 (Moderate Compliance)**
- Count: ~25 patterns (26.9%)
- Multiple structural issues

**Score 3/7 (Poor Compliance)**
- Count: ~30 patterns (32.3%)
- Major restructuring needed

**Score 2/7 or below (Critical Non-compliance)**
- Count: ~18 patterns (19.4%)
- Complete transformation required

## Template v2 Adoption Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Requirements (Must-Have)
1. **Essential Question**: 43% compliance
2. **Code Percentage ≤20%**: 4% compliance
3. **Progressive Structure**: 43% compliance

**Phase 1 Overall Compliance**: ~2% (patterns meeting all 3 critical requirements)

### Phase 2: Quality Requirements (Should-Have)
4. **"When NOT to Use" Position**: 67% compliance
5. **Visual Content (3+ diagrams)**: 89% compliance
6. **Decision Matrix**: 58% compliance

### Phase 3: Polish Requirements (Nice-to-Have)
7. **Line Count ≤1000**: 89% compliance

## Template Version Analysis

### Current Template Version Distribution
Based on structural analysis:

- **Template v2 (Full)**: 0 patterns (0%)
- **Template v2 (Partial)**: ~15 patterns (16%)
- **Template v1.5 (Hybrid)**: ~30 patterns (32%)
- **Template v1 (Legacy)**: ~48 patterns (52%)

### Transformation Effort Estimation

**Low Effort (1-2 issues to fix)**
- Count: ~25 patterns
- Effort: 1-2 hours per pattern
- Primary issue: Code percentage reduction

**Medium Effort (3-4 issues to fix)**
- Count: ~40 patterns
- Effort: 3-5 hours per pattern
- Issues: Structure + content + code reduction

**High Effort (5-6 issues to fix)**
- Count: ~28 patterns
- Effort: 6-10 hours per pattern
- Issues: Complete restructuring required

## Priority Matrix for Template v2 Transformation

### High Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins)
Patterns with 1-2 issues, mostly code percentage:
- `eventual-consistency`, `choreography`, `event-streaming`
- Most patterns in data-management with single code issue

### High Impact, Medium Effort (Strategic Focus)
Patterns with 3-4 issues but good structure:
- `sidecar`, `cap-theorem`, `cell-based`
- Well-structured patterns needing content optimization

### High Impact, High Effort (Major Projects)
Patterns with 5-6 issues requiring complete overhaul:
- `distributed-lock`, `leader-election`, `outbox`
- `chunking`, `priority-queue`, `url-normalization`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Focus (Week 1-2)
1. **Transform top 12 critical patterns** (6-issue patterns)
2. **Implement Template v2 validation gates** in CI/CD
3. **Create pattern transformation playbook**

### Short-term Goals (Month 1)
1. **Achieve 25% full compliance** (23 patterns)
2. **Fix all essential question gaps** (40 patterns)
3. **Reduce code-heavy patterns by 50%** (45 patterns under 20%)

### Long-term Vision (Quarter 1)
1. **Achieve 80% full compliance** (74 patterns)
2. **Complete template transformation** for all patterns
3. **Establish maintenance processes** for ongoing compliance
