## YAML Frontmatter Analysis

```yaml

title: Caching Strategies
description: But 80% of requests are for same data!
```text                    # ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Text block in YAML
type: pattern
difficulty: beginner
reading_time: 10 min
prerequisites: []
pattern_type: "general"

```

## Review Results

### 🚨 Critical Issues: 1

#### Issue 1: Code Block in YAML Frontmatter
**Problem**: The line ````text` is breaking the YAML structure
**Location**: Line 4
**Impact**: This will cause MkDocs build failures and break parsing
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Build Breaking

**Root Cause**: Markdown content leaked into the YAML frontmatter during previous processing

### ✅ High Priority Issues: NONE (after critical fix)

### ⚠️ Medium Priority Issues: 1

#### Issue 1: Informal Description
**Problem**: Description is too casual and lacks professionalism
**Current**: "But 80% of requests are for same data!"
**Suggested**: "Optimize performance by storing frequently accessed data in fast storage layers"
