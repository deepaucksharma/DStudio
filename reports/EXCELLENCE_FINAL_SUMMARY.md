### 🔍 Phase 2: Pattern Comparison Matrices (100% Complete)
Created 5 comprehensive comparison matrices:
1. **Messaging Patterns** - Pub-Sub vs Event Streaming vs Message Queue vs WebSocket
2. **Consistency Patterns** - 2PC vs Saga vs Event Sourcing vs CQRS
3. **Caching Patterns** - Client-side vs CDN vs Application vs Database
4. **Deployment Patterns** - Blue-Green vs Canary vs Rolling vs Feature Flags
5. **Resilience Patterns** - Circuit Breaker vs Retry vs Timeout vs Bulkhead vs Rate Limiting

Each with decision matrices, performance characteristics, and migration paths.

### 🏆 Phase 3: Elite Engineering Case Studies (100% Complete)
Created 5 in-depth case studies:
1. **Netflix Chaos Engineering** - 260M+ subscribers, 99.97% availability
2. **Amazon DynamoDB Evolution** - 10T+ requests/day, 99.999% availability
3. **Discord Voice Infrastructure** - 5M+ concurrent users, 28ms latency
4. **Figma CRDT Collaboration** - 100+ concurrent editors, 60 FPS
5. **Stripe API Excellence** - 1B+ requests/day, 8+ years compatibility
