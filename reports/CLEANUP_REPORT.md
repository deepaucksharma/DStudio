# Duplicate and Orphaned Content Cleanup Report

## Summary
Cleaned up duplicate and orphaned content from the documentation structure.

## Files/Directories Removed

### 1. Duplicate Pillars Directory
- **Removed**: `/docs/pillars/`
- **Reason**: Duplicate of `/docs/part2-pillars/` with older, less comprehensive content
- **Details**: The `/docs/part2-pillars/index.md` (35,668 bytes) is the enhanced version with much more detailed content, visual components, and better organization compared to the older `/docs/pillars/index.md` (8,832 bytes)

### 2. Duplicate Cassandra Case Study
- **Removed**: `/docs/case-studies/cassandra-enhanced.md`
- **Kept**: `/docs/case-studies/cassandra.md`
- **Reason**: The non-enhanced version was more recent (2025-07-23 vs 2025-07-21) and had cleaner metadata structure

### 3. Orphaned Pattern Index
- **Removed**: `/docs/patterns/index-new.md`
- **Kept**: `/docs/patterns/index.md`
- **Reason**: Not referenced in `mkdocs.yml`; appears to be an abandoned draft

## Items Reviewed But Kept

### Archive Directory
- **Location**: `/docs/part1-axioms/archive-old-8-axiom-structure/`
- **Decision**: Kept as it's clearly marked as an archive and may contain historical reference material

### Template Files
- Multiple template files exist in different locations but serve different purposes:
  - `/docs/templates/` - General templates
  - `/docs/patterns/PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md` - Pattern-specific template
  - `/docs/case-studies/CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md` - Case study-specific template

### Enhanced Files Without Non-Enhanced Counterparts
The following enhanced files don't have duplicate non-enhanced versions:
- `digital-wallet-enhanced.md`
- `distributed-email-enhanced.md`
- `gaming-leaderboard-enhanced.md`
- `prometheus-datadog-enhanced.md`
- `s3-object-storage-enhanced.md`
- `law1-failure-enhanced.md`
- `cap-theorem-enhanced.md`

## Results
- **Directories removed**: 1
- **Files removed**: 2
- **Space saved**: ~65KB
- **Confusion reduced**: Eliminated duplicate content that could cause maintenance issues

## Recommendations
1. Consider renaming files with "-enhanced" suffix to remove the suffix if they're the only version
2. Regularly audit for duplicate content as the documentation evolves
3. Establish naming conventions to prevent future duplicates
