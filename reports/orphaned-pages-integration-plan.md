# Orphaned Pages Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 523 markdown files revealed 327 orphaned pages (62.52%). This plan integrates all valuable orphaned content into the navigation structure using the excellence framework categorization.

## Critical Findings

### 1. High-Value Orphaned Patterns
- **Consensus Pattern** (`patterns/consensus.md`) - Gold tier, essential for distributed coordination
- **Publish-Subscribe Pattern** (`patterns/publish-subscribe.md`) - Gold tier, foundation of event-driven architectures
- **Message Queue** (`patterns/message-queue.md`) - Gold tier, critical for async communication
- **Distributed Transactions** (`patterns/distributed-transactions.md`) - Silver tier, advanced coordination
- **Rate Limiting** (`patterns/rate-limiting.md`) - Already in nav but misplaced

### 2. Missing Case Studies (80 total, many orphaned)
