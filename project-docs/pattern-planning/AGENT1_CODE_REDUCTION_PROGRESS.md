# Agent 1: Code Reduction Progress Report

## Mission
Reduce code content in all pattern library files to achieve <20% code per pattern.

## Initial Analysis (2025-08-04)
- **Total Patterns Analyzed**: 91
- **Patterns with >20% Code**: 89 (97.8%)
- **Success Target**: 100% of patterns with <20% code content

## Progress Update (After Systematic Reduction)
- **Patterns with >20% Code**: 22 (24.2%)
- **Reduction Achieved**: 75% of high-code patterns eliminated
- **Patterns Successfully Reduced**: 69 patterns now under 20% code
- **Remaining Work**: 22 patterns still need reduction

## Strategy
1. Replace implementation code with conceptual pseudocode (5-10 lines max)
2. Convert code-heavy explanations to tables or bullet points
3. Extract large code examples to "See full implementation" links
4. Focus on concepts over implementation details
5. Use comments to explain what code does rather than showing full code
