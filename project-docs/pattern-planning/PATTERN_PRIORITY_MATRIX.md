# Pattern Priority Matrix & Visual Roadmap

## Impact vs Effort Matrix

### üéØ Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Do First - Week 1**

| Pattern | Current Issues | 2-Hour Fix | Impact |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------|
| circuit-breaker | No essential Q | Add EQ + state diagram | High traffic pattern |
| api-gateway | Verbose, buried info | Add EQ + decision matrix | Entry point for many |
| timeout | Good content, poor structure | Restructure + add EQ | Prevents cascades |
| health-check | Missing decision criteria | Add when to/not use | Foundation pattern |
| service-discovery | Code in TOC bug | Fix bug + add EQ | Core microservices |

### üíé Strategic Wins (High Impact, High Effort)
**Do Next - Week 2-3**

| Pattern | Current Issues | 4-8 Hour Fix | Impact |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| retry-backoff | 2200 lines, no template | Major refactor to 1000 lines | Most visited pattern |
| saga | 1600 lines but good | Reduce 40% + visuals | Complex transactions |
| event-sourcing | Hidden value prop | Complete restructure | Growing adoption |
| sharding | Code-heavy (1500 lines) | Visual transformation | Scale foundation |
| service-mesh | Everything buried | Information architecture | Modern standard |

### üìà Fill-ins (Low Impact, Low Effort)
**Do in Batches - Week 3**

| Pattern | Fix Needed | Batch Strategy |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Bronze patterns (11) | Add migration guides | Template sprint |
| Coordination patterns | Add essential Qs | Category batch |
| Simple patterns | Length reduction | Bulk edit |

### ‚è≥ Defer (Low Impact, High Effort)
**Do Last or Reconsider - Week 4**

| Pattern | Issue | Alternative Approach |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Legacy patterns | Complete rewrite | Link to modern alternatives |
| Niche patterns | Low usage | Minimal viable improvement |
| Complex rewrites | 10+ hour effort | Phase 2 consideration |

## Pattern Categories by Priority

### üî¥ Priority 1: User-Facing Foundations (Week 1)
Must be perfect - these shape first impressions

| Category | Patterns | Why Critical |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| API Entry | api-gateway, graphql-federation | First touch point |
| Resilience Basics | circuit-breaker, retry-backoff, timeout | Prevent outages |
| Service Basics | service-discovery, health-check | Microservices 101 |

### üü† Priority 2: Scale & Performance (Week 2)
High-traffic systems depend on these

| Category | Patterns | Why Critical |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Data Scale | sharding, partitioning, consistent-hashing | Scale foundations |
| Traffic Management | load-balancing, rate-limiting, backpressure | Handle load |
| Caching | caching-strategies, cdn, edge-computing | Performance critical |

### üü° Priority 3: Advanced Patterns (Week 3)
Complex but essential for mature systems

| Category | Patterns | Why Important |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Distributed Transactions | saga, event-sourcing, cqrs | Complex workflows |
| Coordination | consensus, leader-election, distributed-lock | Distributed state |
| Advanced Architecture | service-mesh, cell-based, event-driven | Modern architectures |

### üü¢ Priority 4: Specialized Patterns (Week 4)
Important but narrower use cases

| Category | Patterns | When Needed |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Streaming | kafka patterns, stream processing | Real-time systems |
| Security | zero-trust, encryption patterns | Security-first |
| Migration | strangler-fig, anti-corruption | Legacy modernization |

"When should we [choose approach A] instead of [approach B]?"
"What's the best way to [achieve goal] at [scale]?"
```

### Visual Metaphor Sources
- Everyday objects (circuit breaker ‚Üí electrical panel)
- Nature (strangler fig ‚Üí vine wrapping tree)
- Transportation (load balancer ‚Üí traffic controller)
- Business (saga ‚Üí multi-step transaction)

### Decision Matrix Template
```markdown
| Factor | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Performance | Good | Better | Best |
| Cost | $ | $$ | $$$ |
| When to use | [scenario] | [scenario] | [scenario] |
```

## Risk Heatmap

### üî¥ High Risk Areas
- Breaking existing links/bookmarks
- Removing valuable content while cutting
- Inconsistent application of template

### üü° Medium Risk Areas  
- User adaptation to new format
- Mobile performance issues
- Cross-reference accuracy

### üü¢ Low Risk Areas

- Rendering diagrams

## The Path Forward

1. **Today**: Prioritize patterns using this matrix
2. **Tomorrow**: Start with 5 quick wins
3. **This Week**: Transform top 10 patterns
4. **This Month**: Achieve 100% compliance
5. **Next Quarter**: Build on solid foundation

Success comes from disciplined execution of high-impact improvements first, building momentum through visible wins, and maintaining quality through systematic validation.
