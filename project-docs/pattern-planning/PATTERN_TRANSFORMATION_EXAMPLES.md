## The reality of distributed systems

When you make a network call, three things can happen:
1. Success - Your request completes successfully
2. Failure - Your request fails with an error
3. Unknown - The connection drops, times out, or you never get a response

In distributed systems, transient failures are the norm, not the exception...

# Retry with Exponential Backoff

!!! success "üèÜ Gold Standard Pattern"
    **Intelligent failure recovery** ‚Ä¢ AWS, Google Cloud, Netflix proven
    
    The essential pattern for handling transient failures in distributed systems. 
    Prevents cascade failures while maximizing success rates through exponential 
    backoff with jitter - handling billions of requests daily.

## Essential Question
**How do we distinguish between transient and permanent failures, retrying the former without creating thundering herds?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

### Use When
| Scenario | Example | Success Rate |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Network timeouts | API calls | 95%+ recovery |
| Rate limiting | 429 errors | 99%+ recovery |
| Temporary unavailability | 503 errors | 90%+ recovery |

### DON'T Use When
| Scenario | Why | Alternative |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Business logic errors | Won't fix with retry | Fix the logic |
| Authentication failures | Credentials won't improve | Refresh token |
| Data validation errors | Bad data stays bad | Validate first |

### The Story
Imagine calling a busy restaurant. First busy signal? Try again in 1 second. 
Still busy? Wait 2 seconds. Then 4, 8, 16... Eventually you get through 
without overwhelming their phone system.

### Visual Metaphor
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Request] --> B{Success?}
    B -->|No| C[Wait 1s]
    C --> D[Retry 1]
    D --> E{Success?}
    E -->|No| F[Wait 2s]
    F --> G[Retry 2]
    G --> H{Success?}
    H -->|No| I[Wait 4s + jitter]
```

### Core Insight
**Without jitter**: All clients retry simultaneously ‚Üí thundering herd
**With jitter**: Clients spread out ‚Üí gradual recovery

## Level 2: Foundation (10 min)

### Key Formula
```
delay = min(base * (2 ^ attempt) + random_jitter, max_delay)
```

### Architecture Components
| Component | Purpose | Typical Values |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Base delay | Starting wait time | 100-1000ms |
| Multiplier | Growth factor | 2 (exponential) |
| Jitter | Randomization | ¬±25% of delay |
| Max retries | Failure limit | 3-5 attempts |
| Max delay | Cap on wait time | 30-60 seconds |

### Basic Example (Conceptual)
```python
def retry_with_backoff(func, max_attempts=3):
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            return func()
        except TransientError:
            if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
                raise
            delay = min(100 * (2 ** attempt) + random(0, 25), 30000)
            sleep(delay / 1000)
```

### Retry Decision Tree
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Error Occurs] --> B{Error Type?}
    B -->|4xx Client| C[Don't Retry]
    B -->|5xx Server| D{Which Code?}
    D -->|500| E[Retry with backoff]
    D -->|503| E
    D -->|504| E
    D -->|501| F[Don't retry]
    B -->|Network| G{Idempotent?}
    G -->|Yes| E
    G -->|No| H[Check state first]
```

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Retry Storms**: No jitter ‚Üí synchronized retries
2. **Infinite Loops**: No max attempts ‚Üí resource exhaustion  
3. **Wrong Errors**: Retrying permanent failures
4. **State Corruption**: Retrying non-idempotent operations

## Level 4: Expert (20 min)

### Advanced Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Circuit Breaker Integration | Repeated failures | Skip retries when circuit open |
| Adaptive Retry | Variable load | Adjust based on success rate |
| Priority-based | Mixed importance | High-priority gets more retries |
| Hedged Requests | Low latency critical | Parallel retry before timeout |

### Production Considerations
- **Observability**: Log attempt number, delay, reason
- **Metrics**: Track retry rates, success rates by attempt
- **Budgets**: Limit total retry time per request
- **Context**: Propagate deadline/timeout awareness

## Level 5: Mastery (30 min)

### Real-world Implementation (AWS SDK)
- Uses exponential backoff with full jitter
- Adapts based on error type (throttling vs timeout)
- Integrates with service-specific retry policies
- Handles both sync and async operations

### Netflix's Approach
- Combines with circuit breakers and bulkheads
- Uses request hedging for critical paths
- Adaptive concurrency limits prevent overload
- Monitors retry budget consumption

### Migration Strategy
1. **Identify retry points** in current code
2. **Classify errors** (transient vs permanent)
3. **Add instrumentation** before changing behavior
4. **Roll out gradually** with feature flags
5. **Monitor impact** on downstream services

## Quick Reference

### Decision Matrix
| Factor | Low Retry | Medium Retry | High Retry |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Request cost | High | Medium | Low |
| Idempotency | Maybe | Yes | Required |
| Time sensitivity | Critical | Important | Flexible |
| Error rate | <1% | 1-5% | >5% |

### Configuration Examples
```yaml
# Conservative (financial transactions)
base_delay_ms: 1000
max_attempts: 3
max_delay_ms: 5000
jitter_factor: 0.1

# Aggressive (read-only APIs)
base_delay_ms: 100
max_attempts: 5
max_delay_ms: 30000
jitter_factor: 0.5
```

**Target**: Crisp question, visual diagrams, scannable format

### Before (Selected Issues)
```markdown
## The Essential Question

**How can clients make a single request and let the platform handle routing, 
security, and protocol conversion?**

[Long verbose explanation of what this means...]

### Visual Metaphor

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Without API Gateway"
        C1[Client] --> AS[Auth Service]
        C1 --> US[User Service]
        C1 --> OS[Order Service]
        C1 --> PS[Payment Service]
        C1 --> IS[Inventory Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "With API Gateway"
        [More verbose diagram code]
    end
```

### After (Transformed)
```markdown
## Essential Question
**How do we unify microservice access while handling auth, routing, and protocols?**

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

<div class="decision-box">
<h4>‚úÖ Perfect Fit</h4>

- **10+ microservices** needing unified access
- **Multiple client types** (web, mobile, IoT)
- **Cross-cutting concerns** (auth, logging, rate limiting)
- **Protocol translation** needed (REST‚ÜígRPC)
</div>

<div class="failure-vignette">
<h4>‚ùå Wrong Choice</h4>

- **< 5 services**: Direct communication simpler
- **Ultra-low latency**: Extra hop adds 5-10ms
- **Internal services only**: Service mesh better
- **Simple proxying**: Use reverse proxy (nginx)
</div>

*Single entry point routing to multiple backend services*

### Core Value
| Without Gateway | With Gateway |
|-----------------|--------------|
| N√óM client-service connections | N clients ‚Üí 1 gateway ‚Üí M services |
| Each client handles auth | Centralized authentication |
| Protocol per service | Unified REST/GraphQL interface |
| Scattered rate limiting | Single point of control |
