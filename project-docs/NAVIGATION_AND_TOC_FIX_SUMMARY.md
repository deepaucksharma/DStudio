# Navigation and TOC Fix Summary

## Problem
After the previous layout changes:
1. The left navigation moved to center
2. "On This Page" (TOC) was not clearing properly
3. Custom CSS was overriding Material's default layout system

## Root Cause
The custom CSS files (`layout.css`, `content-boundaries.css`, `navigation.css`) were too aggressive in overriding Material for MkDocs' default layout system, breaking the navigation and TOC positioning.

## Solution
Removed all problematic custom layout CSS and returned to Material's default layout system with minimal additions:

### Files Removed
- `layout.css` - Was overriding core layout
- `content-boundaries.css` - Too many overrides
- `navigation.css` - Had conflicting positioning
- `layout-fix.css` - Attempted fix that didn't work

### Files Kept/Added
- `custom.css` - Basic custom styling (no layout changes)
- `themes.css` - Section color themes
- `responsive-table.css` - Table responsiveness only
- `content-limits.css` - Minimal overflow prevention

### Key Changes
1. **Removed all position, width, and margin overrides**
2. **Let Material handle the layout completely**
3. **Only added minimal CSS for**:
   - Word wrapping to prevent overflow
   - Scrollable code blocks and tables
   - Image scaling
   - Table max-width

## Result
- Navigation stays in its proper left position
- TOC ("On This Page") displays correctly on the right
- Content respects boundaries naturally through Material's layout
- No custom layout overrides to break Material's responsive design

## Lesson Learned
When using Material for MkDocs, it's best to work WITH the theme's layout system rather than trying to override it. The theme already handles complex responsive layouts correctly.
