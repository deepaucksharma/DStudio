    behavioral_content = '''# STAR+ Method for Leadership Scenarios

## Overview

The STAR+ method extends the traditional STAR framework with crucial elements for leadership interviews at FAANG companies.

## The STAR+ Framework

### Traditional STAR
- **S**ituation - Context and background
- **T**ask - Your responsibility  
- **A**ction - What you did
- **R**esult - The outcome

### The "+" Additions for Leadership
- **L**earnings - What you learned and applied
- **S**cale - Size and complexity demonstrated
- **I**mpact - Long-term effects beyond immediate results

## Leadership Dimensions to Highlight

### 1. Scale and Complexity
Always quantify:
- Team size (direct and indirect reports)
- Budget responsibility
- User impact (MAU, revenue)
- Technical complexity (services, data volume)
- Timeline and constraints

### 2. Stakeholder Management
Demonstrate interaction with:
- Executive leadership (VP, C-level)
- Cross-functional partners (Product, Design, Sales)
- External partners and customers
- Board members (for senior roles)

### 3. Decision Making Under Ambiguity
Show how you:
- Gathered incomplete information
- Made reversible vs irreversible decisions  
- Balanced speed vs accuracy
- Communicated uncertainty

## Example: Scaling Engineering Team

### Situation
"At [Company], our engineering team of 12 was struggling to meet product demands as we grew from 100K to 1M users in 6 months."

### Task  
"As Engineering Manager, I needed to triple the team size while maintaining quality bar and team culture."

### Action
"I implemented a three-pronged approach:
1. **Hiring Strategy**: Partnered with recruiting to build a dedicated pipeline, implemented structured interviews, and trained 8 engineers as interviewers
2. **Onboarding Excellence**: Created a 2-week bootcamp reducing ramp time from 3 months to 6 weeks
3. **Team Structure**: Introduced pod model with tech leads, enabling autonomous execution"

### Result
"Successfully scaled to 38 engineers in 9 months, maintained 95% offer acceptance rate, and improved deployment frequency from weekly to daily"

### Learning
"I learned that scaling isn't just about hiring‚Äîit's about building systems. This experience led me to create a company-wide scaling playbook used by 5 other teams."

### Scale
"This transformation impacted 200+ employees across Product and Engineering, enabled $15M in new revenue, and became the blueprint for scaling from Series B to C."

### Impact
"Two years later, 6 of those engineers became managers themselves, and the pod structure is still used across the 150-person engineering org."

## Common Leadership Scenarios

    # Create Amazon-specific content
    amazon_content = '''# Amazon Leadership Principles Deep Dive for Engineering Leaders

## Overview

Amazon's interview process for engineering leaders (L6+) heavily focuses on Leadership Principles (LPs). You'll face 4-6 behavioral interviews, each targeting 2-3 specific LPs. Success requires demonstrating these principles at scale.

## The Bar Raiser Process

### What to Expect
- One interviewer is a trained Bar Raiser
- They have veto power over hiring decisions
- Focus on long-term potential, not just current skills
- Will dig deep with "Tell me more" follow-ups

### How to Prepare
- Have 2-3 stories per Leadership Principle
- Include failure stories (Learn and Be Curious)
- Quantify everything with data
- Show increasing scope over time

## L6+ Leadership Principles Deep Dive

### 1. Ownership (Critical for L6+)

**What It Means at Scale**:
- Own outcomes beyond your immediate team
- Think like a General Manager
- No "that's not my job" mentality
- Long-term thinking (3+ years)

**L6 Example Story Structure**:
"When our payment system reliability dropped to 97.5%, affecting $2M daily transactions, I owned the resolution despite payments being outside my direct scope. I formed a virtual team across 3 organizations, led the architecture review, and implemented a new monitoring system. Result: 99.99% reliability, saving $500K annually in failed transaction costs."

**Interview Questions**:
- "Tell me about a time you took ownership of something outside your area"
- "Describe a situation where you had to make a decision with long-term implications"
- "When have you sacrificed short-term gains for long-term value?"

### 2. Deliver Results (Table Stakes)

**L7+ Expectations**:
- Deliver business impact, not just features
- Handle multiple competing priorities
- Drive results through influence
- Overcome significant obstacles

**Key Metrics to Highlight**:
- Revenue impact ($X million)
- Cost savings (X% reduction)
- Performance improvements (Xms ‚Üí Yms)
- Team productivity (X% increase)

**Power Story Framework**:
"Despite [major obstacle], I delivered [specific result] by [innovative approach], resulting in [business impact] and [long-term benefit]."

### 3. Hire and Develop the Best

**Leadership Demonstration**:
- Building diverse teams from scratch
- Developing future leaders
- Creating talent pipelines
- Improving hiring processes

**L6 Story Example**:
"I raised our hiring bar by implementing structured interviews, resulting in offer acceptance increasing from 60% to 85% and new hire performance ratings improving by 30%. I personally mentored 5 engineers to promotion, with 2 becoming managers."

### 4. Think Big (L7+ Differentiator)

**Scale of Thinking**:
- L6: Transform your product area
- L7: Transform your organization  
- L8: Transform the company

**Story Elements**:
- Ambitious vision (10x, not 10%)
- Challenge status quo
- Inspire others to join
- Deliver step-function change

### 5. Earn Trust (Stakeholder Management)

**Engineering Leader Focus**:
- Transparent communication during outages
- Building credibility with non-technical leaders
- Admitting mistakes and showing growth
- Data-driven decision making

**Anti-patterns to Avoid**:
- Blaming others or circumstances
- Hiding problems until too late
- Over-promising and under-delivering
- Not admitting knowledge gaps

### 6. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

**Senior Leadership Nuance**:
- Disagree with senior leaders respectfully
- Know when to escalate vs commit
- Build coalition when needed
- Document decisions and rationale

**Story Structure**:
"I respectfully disagreed with [senior leader] about [technical decision] because [data/reasoning]. I proposed [alternative] and after healthy debate, we agreed to [outcome]. I then fully committed by [specific actions]."

### 7. Dive Deep (Technical Credibility)

**L6+ Balance**:
- Stay technical enough to make informed decisions
- Know when to dive deep vs delegate
- Use technical knowledge to unblock teams
- Identify systemic issues from details

## Interview Day Strategy

### Interview Loop Structure
1. **Hiring Manager**: Overall fit + 2-3 LPs
2. **Skip Level**: Think Big, Ownership
3. **Peer Managers**: Earn Trust, Deliver Results  
4. **Bar Raiser**: Any LPs, culture fit
5. **Technical**: Dive Deep, Think Big

### STAR Story Bank

Create 15-20 stories covering:
- Scaling teams (Hire and Develop)
- Technical migrations (Ownership, Think Big)
- Conflict resolution (Earn Trust, Backbone)
- Failure recovery (Learn and Be Curious)
- Process improvements (Insist on High Standards)

### The "Tell Me More" Technique

Be prepared for 3-4 follow-ups:
1. Initial story (2 minutes)
2. "What was your specific role?" (30 seconds)
3. "What would you do differently?" (30 seconds)
4. "How did you measure success?" (30 seconds)
5. "What was the lasting impact?" (30 seconds)

    # Create technical leadership content
    tech_leadership = '''# Technical Strategy for Engineering Leaders

## Overview

As an engineering leader at L6+, you must balance staying technical enough to make informed decisions while operating at a strategic level. This guide covers how to demonstrate technical leadership in interviews.

## The Technical Leadership Paradox

### The Challenge
- Too technical ‚Üí "Why aren't you an IC?"
- Too high-level ‚Üí "Do you still understand the tech?"
- Just right ‚Üí Strategic thinking grounded in technical reality

### The Sweet Spot
Show you can:
1. Understand technical implications of business decisions
2. Translate between engineering and business stakeholders  
3. Make architectural decisions with long-term thinking
4. Guide technical direction without micromanaging

## Core Technical Strategy Topics

### 1. Platform vs Product Thinking

**Key Interview Question**: "How do you decide when to build a platform?"

**Framework Answer**:
```
1. Current State Analysis
   - 3+ teams solving similar problems
   - 30%+ duplicate effort across teams
   - Inconsistent user experience

2. Platform Investment Criteria  
   - ROI positive within 18 months
   - Enables 5x velocity after adoption
   - Reduces operational overhead 50%

3. Migration Strategy
   - Start with willing early adopters
   - Build migration tools, not mandates
   - Measure adoption and satisfaction
```

**Real Example Structure**:
"At [Company], 5 teams were building separate authentication systems. I led the platform initiative that consolidated into a single identity platform, reducing authentication bugs by 70% and enabling SSO across all products. The 6-month investment paid back in 8 months through reduced duplicate work."

### 2. Technical Debt Strategy

**Leadership Approach to Tech Debt**:

#### Classification Framework
1. **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks
2. **High**: Performance degradation, maintenance burden
3. **Medium**: Developer experience, minor inefficiencies  
4. **Low**: Code cleanup, nice-to-haves

#### Investment Strategy
- Allocate 20% of capacity to debt reduction
- Tie debt work to business outcomes
- Create "Tech Debt Friday" culture
- Measure debt impact in dollars

#### Story Example
"I inherited a team where deployment took 4 hours due to technical debt. Rather than a big rewrite, I implemented a quarterly 'Tech Debt Sprint' where we'd fix the highest-ROI items. After 1 year, deployment time dropped to 15 minutes, saving 100 engineering hours/month."

### 3. Build vs Buy Decisions

**Decision Framework**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Capability Needed] --> B{Core to Business?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Existing Solutions?}
    B -->|No| D[Buy/SaaS]
    C -->|Yes| E{Meets 80% Needs?}
    C -->|No| F[Build]
    E -->|Yes| G{TCO Analysis}
    E -->|No| F
    G -->|Build Cheaper| F
    G -->|Buy Cheaper| D
```

**Interview Answer Template**:
"When evaluating [specific technology], I consider:
1. Strategic importance (is this our differentiator?)
2. Total cost of ownership over 3 years
3. Opportunity cost of engineering time
4. Vendor lock-in risks
5. Security and compliance requirements"

### 4. Architecture Reviews

**How to Run Effective Architecture Reviews**:

#### Pre-Review (L6+ Leader Actions)
- Set clear decision criteria
- Ensure right stakeholders included
- Pre-read documents
- Identify key risks

#### During Review
- Ask probing questions, don't prescribe solutions
- Focus on non-functional requirements
- Challenge assumptions respectfully
- Document decisions and rationale

#### Post-Review
- Clear action items with owners
- Follow-up on implementation
- Share learnings broadly
- Update architecture guidelines

### 5. Innovation Framework

**Creating Space for Innovation**:

#### 20% Time Reality
"I implemented 'Innovation Fridays' where engineers could work on anything that might benefit the company. Rules: Demo monthly, measure impact, ship if successful. Result: 3 major features came from this, including our ML-based error detection saving $2M annually."

#### Hackathon Strategy  
- Theme-based (e.g., "Developer Productivity")
- Cross-functional teams required
- Executive judging panel
- Winner gets resourced for production

#### Innovation Metrics
- Ideas generated per quarter
- % of ideas reaching production
- Revenue from innovation projects
- Patent applications filed

## System Design for Leaders

### Different Focus Areas

#### IC System Design
- API design
- Database schemas  
- Algorithm efficiency
- Caching strategies

#### Leadership System Design
- Team boundaries (Conway's Law)
- Service ownership models
- Cross-team dependencies
- Organizational scaling

### Example: Designing a Notification System

**IC Approach**:
"I'd use Redis for queuing, PostgreSQL for templates, and websockets for real-time delivery..."

**Leadership Approach**:
"I'd first identify which teams need notifications - likely 5-6 teams. Rather than each building their own, I'd create a platform team owning a notification service. Key decisions:
- API design that prevents abuse
- SLA guarantees for different priority levels
- Cost model for internal charging
- Migration path for existing systems
- Team size: 4 engineers, 1 PM, 1 designer"

## Technical Competency Demonstrations

### 1. Staying Current

**Interview Question**: "How do you stay technical as a leader?"

**Strong Answer**:
"I maintain technical relevance through:
- Monthly architecture reviews where I ask deep questions
- Quarterly hack days where I code alongside the team
- Reading one technical paper/week in our domain
- Maintaining a side project in emerging tech
- Regular 1:1s with principal engineers"

### 2. Technical Decision Making

**Framework for Technical Decisions**:
1. **Gather Context**: Understand problem space
2. **Identify Options**: Usually 3-4 viable approaches
3. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Performance vs cost vs time
4. **Prototype if Needed**: Spike highest-risk elements
5. **Decide and Document**: Clear rationale for future
6. **Measure Results**: Did we achieve intended outcomes?

### 3. Managing Technical Leaders

**Challenge**: Leading senior engineers who know more than you

**Approach**:
- Leverage their expertise, don't compete
- Focus on removing obstacles
- Connect their work to business impact
- Create growth opportunities
- Be the umbrella, not the expert

## Red Flags to Avoid

### In Technical Discussions
- ‚ùå Pretending to know technologies you don't
- ‚ùå Making decisions without consulting experts
- ‚ùå Using outdated technical references
- ‚ùå Micromanaging implementation details

### In Leadership Context  
- ‚ùå "I told the team exactly how to build it"
- ‚ùå "I don't need to understand the technical details"
- ‚ùå "We always use [specific technology]"
- ‚ùå "Technical debt isn't a priority"

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Platform Migration
"Your company has 50 microservices on a deprecated platform. How do you lead the migration?"

### Scenario 2: AI/ML Investment  
"The CEO wants every team using AI. How do you implement this directive responsibly?"

### Scenario 3: Security Incident
"A critical vulnerability is discovered on Friday afternoon. Walk through your response."

### Scenario 4: Technical Hiring
"You need to hire 5 senior engineers in a competitive market. What's your strategy?"

**Key Takeaway**: Technical leadership isn't about being the best coder‚Äîit's about making informed decisions, creating the right environment for technical excellence, and translating between technology and business value.'''
