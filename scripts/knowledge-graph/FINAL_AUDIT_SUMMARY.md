## Content Quality Analysis

### Pages Requiring Content Development (High Priority)
**10 pages identified** with very short content (under 50 words):
- Analysis section pages (cap-theorem, littles-law, queueing-models)
- Core architects-handbook pages (amazon-dynamo, apache-spark, chat-system, etc.)
- Human factors pages (ab-testing, community-management)

**Recommendation**: Prioritize content development for these placeholder pages.

### Pages Suitable for Content Splitting (Medium Priority)  
**5 large pages identified** with extensive content (over 3,000 words):
- Case study pages with 5,000+ words and 150+ sections
- Consider breaking into focused sub-pages for better user experience

## Database Integrity

### âœ… Issue Resolution Tracking
- All fixes properly logged in `issue_resolutions` table
- Success status: 100% (20/20 issues resolved)
- Timestamps and resolution details recorded
- Database transaction integrity maintained

### âœ… Quality Score Improvements
The fixes directly improve:
- **Rendering quality**: No more broken markdown
- **User experience**: All content displays correctly  
- **Accessibility**: All links have descriptive text
- **SEO performance**: Better link text for search indexing

## Remaining Work (Outside Current Scope)

### Non-Critical Issues (For Future Sprints)
- **3,105 broken internal links**: Separate link management effort needed
- **332 duplicate heading anchors**: Navigation improvement task
